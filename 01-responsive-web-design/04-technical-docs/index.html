        <p class="lead">Welcome to Framer X. Learn all about the new tools, components, store, code and more.
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Framer X is both the most easy and most advanced design tool. We think a subset of more advanced users will
          build components for everyone else, so the majority of users won’t write code, but visually compose
          interfaces with components built by others through the store. But if you enjoy writing code, Framer X will be
          the best environment to do so and we encourage everyone to explore it.</p>
        <p>The idea behind Framer X is not to generate code for you, but instead to use the code you (or someone else)
          wrote. Auto-generated code almost never ends up in production, so it’s better to have a tool that can use
          code that you already have. If you already have React components built, they should work in Framer X with
          minimal effort. That said, everything you draw in Framer is a React component and exportable to jsx, html or
          static assets if you need it.</p>

        <header class="main-heading">Canvas</header>
        <p class="lead">Your Canvas is ground zero for experimenting with concepts and designing flows. Draw directly
          on the canvas or insert device frames. Use these docs to learn the basics of our interface and features.</p>
        <p>The Framer X interface will be familiar to most, with a large canvas, device preview, and full-featured
          toolkit. Like many of the other graphic design tools, Framer X offers the same insertable shapes and text,
          all easily styled using the properties panel. You can draw directly on the canvas, import vector assets, or
          even set up a series of Frames to create a multi-screen app flow. Designing on the canvas works great for
          smaller interactions, but we recommend using frames for complex and responsive app flows.</p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <h5>Pan</h5>
        <p>When working on the canvas, you can use the
          <strong>Pan tool</strong>
          to quickly pan over your canvas. Select the Pan tool or hold down
          <code>space</code>, then click and drag to pan in any&nbsp;direction.</p>
        <h5>Zoom</h5>
        <p>You can use the Zoom tool (or use the shorthand
          <code>Z</code>) to quickly zoom in-and-out of anything that is on your canvas. You can zoom out as far as 10%
          (to get a great overview of all your Frames) or zoom in all the way up to 3200% to focus on the nitty-gritty.</p>
        <h5>Direct Selection</h5>
        <p>You can easily select any layer on the Canvas by simply clicking on them. Often, you know exactly which
          layer you want to select. In those cases, you can simply hold
          <code>CMD</code>
          while you make your selection so that you are able to directly select that nested Frame.</p>
        <h5>Resize</h5>
        <p>The four handles around any layer can also be used to resize the layer. Select a handle and drag to resize.
          Hold down the
          <code>Shift</code>
          key and it will resize it by proportion, keeping the height and width at the same ratio. Hold down the
          <code>Option</code>
          key to resize both sides, either vertically, horizontally or all sides.</p>
        <h5>Rotation</h5>
        <p>When your cursor hovers just outside of one of the four handles of your Frame or Shape you will be able to
          rotate the object. Alternatively, you can use the Rotation property within the properties panel.</p>
        <h5>Radius</h5>
        <p>By clicking on the circle located near the top-left corner of a Frame or Shape you can adjust the radius.
          Drag it to the center or from it to customize. Alternatively, you can use the Radius property within the
          properties panel.</p>
        <p class="lead">Framer X supports the Sketch Plugin from Framer Studio. This means you can easily copy your
          artboards from Sketch and paste them in Framer X.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s an overview of the specific features and tools included in this plugin.</p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Supported</th>
            <th>Not Supported</th>

            <td>Nested Symbols</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Groups</td>
            <td>Stroke Settings</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Export</h3>
        <p>Exporting works exactly as you’d expect. You can create multiple exports for a single frame or shape to
          cater to multiple resolutions. Simply select a layer and hit export in the bottom right corner of Framer.
          Select one of the pre-made presets or add your own. Adding a suffix to the preset will append this to your
          file name. Clicking the suffix dropdown allows you to save assets to organized folders.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Formats</th>

            <td>4x</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h5>CSS &amp; SVG</h5>
        <p>Right-click a layer and select Copy CSS to copy the CSS values or Copy SVG to copy the SVG values of the
          selected layer to your clipboard. Then paste perfectly formatted CSS or SVG code directly in your favorite
          editor to speed up your development workflow.</p>
        <h5>Copy Image</h5>
        <p>Framer X allows for quick exporting just by right-clicking on a layer. Select Copy Image or hit
          <code>CMD C</code>
          to copy the selected item to your clipboard. You can paste to any app that supports pasting images, easily
          add your exports to documents, create quick mockups, or gather feedback in chat apps.</p>
        <h5>Presets</h5>
        <p>Framer X has a few pre-loaded exporting presets. The iOS and Android presets contain all of the
          platform-specific sizes you’ll need for development. You can always add your own custom preset by hitting “<b>+</b>”
          in the export panel.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Tools">
        <header class="main-heading">Tools</header>
        <p class="lead">Design adaptive interfaces, draw detailed icons and illustrations or build simple multi-screen
          prototypes.</p>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <p>Where Framer X starts to feel different is in the focus and power of its layout design feature set. Our
          layout tools have been developed specifically for interface design. It intuitively guesses hierarchy and
          layout constraints, making for a much more efficient flow when it comes to responsive design work.</p>
        <h5>Frames</h5>
        <p>Create layouts that are responsive to any screen size with our Frames tool, which includes presets for
          desktop, iOS, and Android.</p>
        <p>To insert a Frame, click the Frames icon on the top left corner of Framer X, or press
          <strong>F</strong>
          to insert a frame even faster. In the properties panel on the right, you’ll notice a list of pre-set Frames
          that correspond with the most popular devices and screen dimensions. To create a custom Frame, select the
          Frames tool and then click and drag on the Canvas.</p>
        <p>Frames aren’t limited to a fixed width and height, but are instead dependent on the device you select. Draw
          a frame within a frame to pin it to a side and set hierarchy automatically. Frames even adapt when you
          resize, all while keeping UI elements like buttons, cards, and tab bars completely intact. When one or more
          frames are already on your canvas, Framer automatically guesses where your next frame should be placed.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Frame Positioning</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When you place a new frame (child) on top of another frame (parent), Framer recognizes its placement and
          uses smart positioning to determine its anchoring in relation to the parent frame and the child frame. This
          vastly increases the efficiency of a typical design workflow. If you do need to change the anchor points at
          any time, you can manually do so using the positioning tool in the properties panel.</p>
        <h5>Stacks</h5>
        <p>To take layouts a step further, we now have a brand new
          <strong>Stack</strong>
          tool. Stacks are especially good for expressing truly fluid layouts, because it can automate things such as
          distribution and alignment. You can use the Stack tool by pressing
          <strong>S</strong>
          and then by making a selection on top of all the items that need to be placed within. Release and voila:
          Everything is now automatically aligned and distributed. You can further customize your Stack by using the
          properties panel. If you want to change the way the elements are distributed or if you want to adjust the gap
          and padding.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Distribution</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Automatic distribution of your items is where the Stack tool really shines. Say you have a menu and you wish
          to replace the order of the items in there. When your menu is wrapped within a Stack, you can simply click
          and drag items to move them around.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nesting</strong>
        </p>
        <p>You can even nest multiple stacks inside of a larger stack. Once grouped, you can re-arrange items within
          each individual stack but also within the larger grouped stack.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive</h3>
        <h5>Link Tool</h5>
        <p>The Link tool allows you to create connections between screens. You can activate the tool by hitting <code>L</code>,
          while having a Frame selected. This will display an arrow, following your cursor, which you can drop on any
          other Frame to link the two. Clicking on the first Frame will now trigger a transition to the second.</p>
        <p>The Link tool also comes with a wide variety of options that you can choose from. There are different
          transitions that you can pick from to get your flow working just the way you want it to.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Default transitions</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Push (Default)</li>
          <li>Overlay</li>
          <li>Modal</li>
          <li>Instant</li>
          <li>Flip</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Scroll Tool</h5>
        <p>The Scroll tool allows you to create scrollable areas. Once created, you can link this to any Frame, which
          will mirror the content inside of your scroll area. Make an update in the Frame and it will be reflected in
          your scrollable area immediately.</p>
        <p>The Scroll tool also lets you choose which directions you can use your scrolling:
          <strong>horizontally</strong>,
          <strong>vertically</strong>
          or
          <strong>both</strong>. When choosing "both", you can also lock the direction to prevent diagonal scrolling.
          You can also select the mouse wheel to be turned on or off, so that you can perfectly simulate a mobile
          experience.</p>
        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <p>In Framer X, we make a distinction between graphics and interactive tools. To use the Path tool or any
          Shapes, you will first need to head to the Drawing section in the Tools panel and select Graphic (or hit
          <strong>G</strong>
          at any time). This Graphics tool acts as a container for all your visual artwork. Once you draw a Graphic
          container on the canvas, you’ll notice that your Drawing toolkit appears in the top left corner of your
          canvas.</p>
        <h5>Path Tool</h5>
        <p>To start using the Path tool, first use the Graphics tool to draw a container on the canvas. You’ll notice
          that a set of Drawing tools now appear in the top left corner, along with a Path tool. Our Path tool features
          everything that you want and need. When drawing icons, you’ll often rely on geometric shapes as the
          foundation of your glyph. The Path tool helps you along the way. While drawing or editing a path, we’ll
          suggest the calculated center point for you—so you can quickly find and snap to these points along your
          segment.</p>
        <p>Our Path tool also helps you define diagonal lines because continuing along the exact angle of a previous
          segment is tricky. The tool does the hard work for you—once your cursor comes close enough, we’ll lock your
          angle for you, so you can draw perfectly aligned icons and illustrations.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Curve Bending</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Curve Bending uses synchronized anchor points to guide you closer to your desired curvature, allowing for
          more advanced illustration work. This is especially helpful if you’re departing from geometric shapes and
          moving toward freeform drawing. Click and drag any anchor point to bend and twist the path into more organic
          forms.</p>
        <h5>Shapes</h5>
        <p>To find and use Shapes, first use the Graphics tool to draw a container on the canvas. A set of Drawing
          tools will now appear in the top left corner. Insert rectangles, ovals, polygons, and stars, then use them as
          a starting point for more advanced shapes. Shortcuts: Type
          <strong>R</strong>
          for rectangle,
          <strong>O</strong>
          for oval, and
          <strong>P</strong>
          for polygon. Double-click to edit and customize completely, and use boolean operations to add, subtract,
          intersect, and exclude shapes.</p>
        <p>If you want shapes to act upon layout rules like any other layer, you can wrap them in a Frame by selecting
          the shape and pressing
          <strong>Enter</strong>. This way the Frame will act like a smart container to the shape.</p>
        <h5>Boolean Operations</h5>
        <p>Our boolean operations support functions to add, subtract, intersect, exclude and join shapes. This will let
          you create more complex shape with ease. When selecting a shape, you’ll find our Boolean Operations options
          at the top of the properties panel. Select two shapes, select an option and click again to toggle.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Properties">
        <header class="main-heading">Properties</header>
        <p class="lead">Style elements of your layers like size, radius, fill, multiple shadows, gradients and effects.
          Use the alignment tools and live simulation to accurately position layers for instant responsiveness.</p>
        <p>On the right side of the design canvas, you’ll find a properties panel. Much like any other graphics tool,
          it contains all the tools you need to style the properties of a particular layer. At the top of the panel is
          a series of align tool options. Use them to smartly position your layers within the frame and in relation to
          each other.</p>
        <h3>Frames</h3>
        <p>There are two types of Frames in Framer X. Canvas-level frames and nested frames. Canvas-level frames behave
          like screens: you can select preset devices, customize its orientation and more. They get a white background
          color by default.</p>
        <p>
          If you add another Frame within, it will get a semi-transparent blue background color. This is how you can
          differentiate nested Frames from canvas-level Frames.</p>
        <p>There are four types of Frame properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Layout</strong>: Constraints, Simulation
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generic</strong>: Opacity, Radius, Rotation, etc
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive</strong>: Link, Code
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Styling</strong>: Fill, Shadows, Blur, etc
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p>In Framer, text is added as a layer with some smart properties of its own. A text layer will align logically
          based on where it is placed on the parent frame. For example, a text layer placed on the left side of a
          navigation bar will immediately left align and anchor there, no matter how the parent layer or frame is
          resized or scaled. You can alter the constraints of this automatic alignment at any time by selecting the
          text layer and using the positioning tool in the properties panel.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Resizing Text</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Text layers have two modes that affect their size:
          <strong>"Auto"</strong>
          and
          <strong>"Fixed"</strong>. When set to "Auto", the width and height of the text layer will adjust acoording to
          the content and size of the text itself and can be adjusted via custom controls in the properties panel. When
          set to "Fixed", the size of the text box can be manually adjusted.</p>
        <h3>Styling</h3>
        <p>To view the styling properties of your layers, you can select one or more layers in the layer list or
          highlight them directly on your canvas. Framer contains all of the styling properties you would expect from a
          modern design tool.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gradients</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradients in Framer are based on the
          <a href="https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/do-you-really-understand-css-linear-gradients-631d9a895caf">CSS
            Model</a>. This means our gradients are simple—an angle and two color stops. Resizing a layer will not
          impact the gradients because it will stay true to its angle and automatically adapt to the layer size.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Borders</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Borders lets you add a border around any layer you create in Framer. You can control the color, width, and
          style of the border. Because Framer is web based, you’ll be able to set border styling and individual border
          size for the top, right, bottom, and left of the layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Multiple Shadows</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple Shadows allow you to add more than one shadow to your desired layer. From outer to inner shadows,
          you can stack a combination of as many shadows as you want and customize them individually. Or right-click on
          any shadow and select
          <strong>Duplicate</strong>
          to speed up your workflow. In Framer X, you can even animate individual shadows.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effects</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Effects in Framer adds an extra set of styling capabilites, including blending modes to blend layers and
          colors, object blur to blur an entire object, or background blur to blur the layers behind it. There are also
          filters like Contrast, Grayscale, Hue Rotate, Invert, Saturate and Sepia, for enhanced photo editing.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Preview">
        <header class="main-heading">Preview</header>
        <p class="lead">Framer X includes a standalone Preview window which allows you to see an accurate and live
          representation of anything that you are creating.</p>
        <p>You can open the preview window by clicking on the play icon in the toolbar, or by hitting
          <code>CMD</code>
          +
          <code>P</code>
          with a frame selected. The preview window in Framer X always mirrors your current selection, which means you
          can quickly skip to specific states of your design.</p>
        <h3>Devices</h3>
        <p>
          When you create a Frame you can choose from a wide selection of preset devices, which is located in your
          properties panel under Device. Once a Device is selected, your Frame will automatically resize to the desired
          device its dimensions. The Preview window will then also automatically adjust itself and will, when in
          presentation mode, show your designs on the selected device for a perfect representation.
        </p>
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <h5>Toggle Cursor</h5>
        <p>By default the cursor is turned off while using your prototype in Preview mode. You can quickly turn this on
          by selecting Toggle Cursor. This will then turn on the touch indicator. Click on the menu icon in the
          top-right, select "Toggle Cursor" or hit
          <code>CMD + Shift + C</code>.</p>
        <h5>Toggle Hand</h5>
        <p>To get an accurate feeling of how your prototype would look in the hands of someone else, you can switch on
          the Toggle Hand feature and simulate it perfectly. Click on the menu icon in the top-right, select "Toggle
          Hand" or hit
          <code>CMD + Shift + H</code>.
        </p>
        <h5>Rotate Device</h5>
        <p>Previewing a design and want to quickly switch from landscape to portrait-view? Select Rotate Device and
          your device (and design) will be altered accordingly.
        </p>
        <h5>Keep On Top</h5>
        <p>Select Keep On Top if you want to cement the preview window stuck in the top corner of your window. This
          will let you continue with your design while always having the preview in sight (You can kind of compare this
          to Safari it's Picture-in-Picture mode).
        </p>

          to Safari it's Picture-in-Picture mode).
        </p>
        <p>To start the live preview, click on the mobile phone icon in the top-right corner. Click <strong>"Start
            Preview"</strong> from within the popover. This will start the live server. From here on out, you can
          either scan the QR code with the Camera app on your iOS device, or click "Open in Browser" to preview in your
          browser.</p>

        <p>You can also share this link with others, and they will be able to follow along with all of your changes.
          They’ll see your visual edits as they occur, plus they will be able to interact with your prototype.</p>

        <header class="main-heading">Components</header>
        <p class="lead">
          Components are reusable, interactive building blocks that you can compose into larger ones to make up entire
          screens, interfaces and apps.
        </p>
        <p>In most other graphics tools, components are visual — a picture of a button, slider or toggle. The big
          difference is that in Framer X, components can be interactive. They scroll, click, move and handle input, all
          backed by the popular React JavaScript framework for building interfaces.</p>
        <p>To create a new component, you can navigate to the Components panel and click the
          <strong>New Component</strong>
          button located at the bottom. You can create two types of components: Design and Code. A design component is
          created by selecting an element on your canvas. A code component is created from scratch, and you’ll be
          presented with a new
          <code>.tsx</code>
          file.
        </p>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>First, give your design component a unique name in the Layer Panel. Then, right click on the layer and
          select
          <code>Create Design Component</code>. You can also create new design components from selection by hitting
          <code>CMD + K</code>.
        </p>
        <p>The design components you see in the panel are referred to as a
          <strong>master</strong>
          components. All of your own master components live on the canvas: removing them from the canvas will also
          remove them from the Components panel. If you paste, duplicate or drag a component from the panel to the
          canvas, you’ll create an
          <strong>instance</strong>
          of that component. All changes made to the master will be reflected within each instance. You can still
          override the properties of any single instance and customize things like color, opacity and radius, or layout
          options like position and size. Don’t like the end result? Right-click and hit
          <strong>Reset Overrides</strong>
          to revert styling back to match the master component.</p>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>Interactive components are code components, written in
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>. You can also render plain HTML elements, and style
          them with CSS, so setting up your first code component is easier than it may sound. In our documentation, we
          assume a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript. For a refresher or more information, please read React’s
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">Getting&nbsp;Started</a>
          guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>React</strong>
        </p>
        <p>React components use JSX, an HTML-like markup language. Below you’ll find a very basic example of a React
          component. Notice how the
          <code>render()</code>
          method returns something very close to plain HTML and CSS. As you learn, we highly recommend to check out the
          official
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>
          documentation.</p>
        <h5>Creation</h5>
        <p>To create a new code component, head to the Components panel in the left menu bar and click select
          <code>New Component</code>. Then, select
          <code>from Code</code>, pick a name (no spaces) and click
          <code>Create and Edit</code>.</p>
        <p>Framer X relies on an external editor for writing code so if you have a code editor installed, it should
          automatically open. If you don’t, any editor will work, though we strongly suggest downloading one that
          supports TypeScript (for auto-complete). We recommend
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode by Microsoft</a>
          with the optional
          <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Prettier
            extension</a>
          installed so your code is always formatted consistently. Now, when you open up the code editor, you will see
          the code powering the component, including "hello world" displayed in purple text.
          <p>Dragging the same component onto the canvas will make each one an instance of the original code component,
            no matter where you position them on the canvas. Every time you make a change to the CSS styling or text in
            the code editor, your saved changes will be reflected across the master and all its instances.</p>
          <h5>Canvas</h5>
          <p>Interactive components like scrolling and click handlers don’t animate on the canvas to avoid distracting
            you from the functional aspects of layout design. But you can test your interactive components at any time
            by hitting the Play icon to open the Preview window.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Layout and Sizing</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Every component rendered on the canvas or Preview is wrapped in a frame so they have the same layout rules
            as anything else on the canvas. Both the width and height are passed to the code component as props so you
            can use them.</p>
          <h5>Displaying Canvas Elements</h5>
          <p>Because the code determines the contents of code components, you cannot directly edit code component
            contents on the canvas. But often you'd like a code component to display something else from your canvas.
            For example, a Card component could render an image with some overlay that is somewhere else on your
            canvas. You can accomplish this in two ways.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Using props.children</strong>
          </p>
          <p>React props are basically the attributes for a component to display, and one of those is a list of
            children, or it's contents (like in the DOM or you see in the layer panel). Normally these are determined
            from your code, but in Framer you can set any Frame on your canvas as children for your component. Let's
            look at an example.</p>
          <p>Framer detects you are using the props.children property in your render method and automatically adds a
            connector to each instance of the component on your canvas (a purple dot on the right side, like the scroll
            tool). You can drag a connection from this connector to any Frame on the canvas and it will use it as its
            children to render.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Using canvas imports</strong>
          </p>
          <p>You can easily import and use any named design component. The example below assumes you have a design
            component named
            <code>Row</code>.</p>
          <h5>Custom Properties</h5>
          <p>Code components become exponentially more powerful when they use
            <code>propertyControls</code>, which allows you to customize the user interface of your component, directly
            within our properties panel.</p>
          <p>The only thing you have to do is add a static propertyControls method to your class with a descriptor. It
            will use defaultProps for the defaults and try to type check your descriptors if you added type annotations
            for your props.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Available Controls</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Controls can be described by specifying one of the following types.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Image</li>
            <li>File</li>
            <li>Enum</li>
            <li>SegmentedEnum</li>
            <li>FusedNumber</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Boolean Control</h5>
          <p>Booleans use a segmented control. The segment titles are <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> by
            default but these can be overridden using the <code>enabledTitle</code> and <code>disabledTitle</code>.</p>
          <h5>Number Control</h5>
          <p>Number controls are displayed using an input field and a slider. The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
            values can be specified to constraint the output. The default step size is 1. When a step size smaller then
            1 is entered, the output will be floats. When the unit type is set to %, the input field will display 10 as
            10%.</p>
          <h5>String Control</h5>
          <p>String controls are displayed using a single line input field. A placeholder value can be set when needed.</p>
          <h5>Color Control</h5>
          <p>Color controls are displayed using a color picker popover and a number input for the alpha.</p>
          <h5>Image Control</h5>
          <p>Image controls are displayed using an image picker that shows a small preview. The component receives an
            absolute URL during rendering.</p>
          <h5>File Control</h5>
          <p>File controls are displayed using a file picker that shows the file name after selecting a file. The
            component receives an absolute URL during rendering. The <code>allowedFileTypes</code> is an array
            containing all allowed file types, like so: <code>["json", "obj", "collada"]</code>.</p>
          <h5>Enum Control</h5>
          <p>An enum control displays a pop-up button with a fixed set of string values. The optionTitles can be set to
            have nicely formatted values for in the UI.</p>
          <h5>Segmented Enum Control</h5>
          <p>A segmented enum control is displayed using a segmented control. Since a segmented control has limited
            space this only works for a tiny set of string values.</p>
          <h5>Fused Number Control</h5>
          <p>The fused number control is specifically created for <code>border-radius</code>, <code>border-width</code>,
            and <code>padding</code>. It allows setting a numeric value by either using a single input or by using four
            seperate number inputs. The user can switch from a 1 input to 4 by toggling a boolean.</p>
          <h5>Hiding Controls</h5>
          <p>Controls can be hidden by implementing the hidden function on the property description. The function
            receives an object containing the set properties and returns a boolean. In the following example we hide
            the the <code>inCall</code> boolean control when the connected property is <code>false</code>.</p>

        <p class="lead">Add animations and interactions to any Frame with Code Overrides, and build entire projects
          with state to communicate between different components.</p>
        <p>Code overrides are simple JavaScript functions that facilitate communication between components. You can
          write them yourself and apply to any Frame or Component on your canvas. These functions allow you to override
          styling properties like opacity and fill — but they also allow for interactivity and animation.</p>
        <p>Code overrides can live in any code file in your project. They get discovered as they use the Override type
          specifier (see example below). You can apply any code override to any Frame (or Component) on the canvas from
          the properties panel under “Code”.</p>
        <p>See a simple example below. This will reset the color of a Frame to red, regardless of the background you
          set on the canvas.</p>
        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>For anything interactive, you need events. Events are “things that happen” like a click, tap, swipe, but
          also video ended or device rotated. They consist of a type and a handler with code that needs to be run when
          the event happens. Because you can’t set event handler from the interface in Framer X (today), you need to
          set them with a code override. Event types in Framer follow the same style as in JavaScript (or React) like
          onClick, onTap, onScroll, etc.</p>
        <p>Let’s create a very simple event handler that logs a message to the console with console.log when you click
          it.</p>
        <p>Apply the code override to any Frame on the canvas and click it in the preview. If you open the preview
          console (right bottom icon in the main window) you will see multiple “Hello” messages (in the Console tab).</p>
        <h3>Animations</h3>
        <p>The Framer JavaScript Library comes with a set of advanced animation helpers for high performant accelerated
          graphics that work well with Framer X. They work very well with overrides to animate any Frame on your
          canvas.</p>
        <p>After we import the right parts from the Framer Library, we create a new Animatable number called scaleValue
          with a default value of 1. We use this value to set the scale property initially, and we animate it with a
          spring curve after a click.</p>
        <p>You can also separate the animation from the click event so you can click on one Frame and animate another.
          Just connect the scaleUp code override to one of the Frames so it sets the scale property to the scaleValue
          value. Connect the other Frame to scaleButton, which animates the scaleValue on a click.</p>

        <header class="main-heading">Store</header>
        <p class="lead">Framer X includes an in-app store, containing packages created by thousands of designers and
          engineers from the Framer community.</p>
        <p>Any design or code component can be packaged and published to the store. Packages can contain a variety of
          components: from complete interactive design systems to media players to image generators and so much more.</p>
        <h3>Installing</h3>
        <p>By default, the store shows you all of our
          <strong>Featured</strong>
          packages. Click on a thumbnail to navigate to its detail page. From here, you can install the package with a
          single click. After installing, the components from the package will appear in the Components panel.</p>
        <h3>Updating</h3>
        <p>When a package you’ve installed is updated by its author, you’ll be notified within the status bar. In the
          bottom-left corner, the amount of updates is shown. Clicking it will bring you to the
          <strong>Installed</strong>
          tab of the store. This is where you can manage your packages: browse, update, and un-install any package
          within your project.
        </p>
        <h3>Publishing</h3>
        <p>If you’ve created design and/or code components you’d like to share with the community, you can navigate to
          the store to publish it. On the bottom of the sidebar, you can click
          <strong>Publish Package</strong>
          to start publishing it. It‘ll often prompt you to save your document first. Then, you’ll be presented by the
          detail page of your package.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Artwork &amp; Descriptions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>To differentiate your package from others, you can add the following assets: a thumbnail, a banner and a
          description of the package contents and features.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Readme</strong>
        </p>
        <p>You can write package descriptions within the
          <code>README.md</code>
          file. This is a markdown file, so you can add titles, subtitles, lists, tables and links.</p>
