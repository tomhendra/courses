No framework vanilla JavaScript course. These tutorials rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page.

We steer clear of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct learning and constrain initial understanding.

## 1. [JavaScript Drum Kit](01-javascript-drum-kit/index-START.html)

- Uses `data-*` HTML attributes and JavaScript attribute selector to add a class to elements on the `keydown` event.
- Also listens for `transitionend` event to remove the class once the CSS transition has completed.

## 2. [CSS & JS Clock](02-js-and-css-clock/index-START.html)

- Use of the `Date()` API in JavaScript to position clock hands with rotate transforms.
- Also demonstrates use of `bezier-timing-function` to transition hands realistically.
