## 1. Introduction

Learn to apply functional programming concepts in JavaScript to make your programs more readable and less error-prone! Kyle Simpson will walk you through the core concepts of functional programming like function purity, point-free style, partial-application, currying, composition, immutability, recursion, and list operations like map/reduce/filter. You'll go even deeper with monads and transduction, two more techniques to add to your tool belt!
