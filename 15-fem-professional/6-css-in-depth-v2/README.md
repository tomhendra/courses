- CSS is the presentation layer of the web.
- Best practice is to use an external style sheet.
- You can place css in the html document head, which will increase performance since css is blocking.
- However if you have a multi-page site you should always use external stylesheets to take advantage of caching.
- Inline styles are possible but should not be used.
- Why use external stylesheets:
  - Allows reusability
  - Eases maintainability
  - Changes are sitewide
  - Changes are instantaneous
  - Interchangeable presentation layer
