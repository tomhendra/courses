### 1.1. Responsive Type Overview

**Responsive Typography in a Nutshell**

- **Performance**:
  - If we don't deal with performance, we don't get to get createive.
  - We don't have a lot of time before users bounce.
  - We need to think about not just what we are loading, but how we are loading it.
  - Select fonts with care, load what we need and don't block the page draw.
- **Progressive**:
  - Web fonts are not supported on many devices.
  - If we don't implement web fonts correctly, some users might not get content at all.
  - We need to embrace FOUT but do so in a way that gets content on the screen and still gives a solid experience.
  - Plan for the future, tune up the loading process & fallback fonts to minimize FOUT.
- **Proportion**:
  - This is one of the most important things.
  - We don't need to have a heading as big on the small screen as it is on the desktop.
  - We must scale proportion.
  - Small screens demand subtle scale.
- **Polish**:
  - There are lots of frameworks that can be used to get up and running.
  - But it is the small details that sets our work apart.
  - Design _IS_ the details: OpenType and then some.

When thinking about a design system it is the perfect time to consider how type will move and scale. Even big corporations don't consider this properly, and there are few design systems on [styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io) that demonstrate it.

We can achieve more typographically on the web than in some cases we can in print, especially with variable fonts.
