## 1. Introduction

- [Slides](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers/blob/master/slides-pdf/Des4Dev2.pdf).
- [Repo](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers).

### 1.1. Right Brain vs Left Brain

- This is a total myth! There are a tonne of [resources](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222) that debunk this.
- People convince them selves that they cannot do something.
- The brain must doesn't work like this. There is no one thing that keeps you from being good at another.
- The more you use your brain in different types of ways, he stringer it becomes.
- So the more we learn outside of our own discipline, the better we become at our discipline.

### 1.2. What this Course Is

- This course aims to touch all foundational topics of design, with resources to delve deeper.
- The directory structure is recommended for working on side projects: insp(iration), src for image and font sources, and dev for the eventual repo.
- Also it is a good structure to see a project through from start to finish, with everything at east access.

### 1.3. Perfection

- When we first start designing, things don't always turn out how we would like them to.
- It is OK, sometimes it takes a few bad designs to arrive at a good one.
- Keep trying, keep working on it, and we will get there.
- We grow by making mistakes and learning from them.

## 2. Layout

- Grids is an old concept for layout which brings order to chaos.
- When we are constructing disparate things, using a grid helps the mind focus and navigate a space.
- Like ancient city plans we as humans have always thought about using grids as a system to find things.
- We can also play around with the entire base concept of the layout with just a few blocks.
- This helps our mind compartmentalize and problem solve.

### 2.1. Balance: Symmetry

- Something can be harmonious by being mirrored on both sides.
- We can start to break symmetry to keep the rhythm in our eye moving around.
- The good thing about symmetry is that if we do break it, the viewers eye goes straight to that point.
- This is a great way to draw attention to something.
- Things can get boring with too much symmetry.

### 2.2. Balance: Asymmetry

- Asymmetry isn't used as much because it is harder to do.
- Creating balance in an asymmetrical canvas can be more tricky.
- Asymmetry asks for more care when balancing things, rather than just alignment we need to be more thoughtful.
- People gravitate towards asymmetry more in terms of preference, probably because the world is not perfectly symmetrical.

### 2.3. Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History

- In photography, the rule of thirds is when we break a composition down into thirds and place the key part in one of the thirds.
- Triad composition uses triangles to draw the eye and prevent it from leaving the canvas.
- Swiss Design is famous for using large flat geometric shapes, using, making and breaking grids very cleanly.

### 2.4. Shape

- Circles draw the eye more than other shapes.
- There is an idea called Saccade where even when looking at something the eye is making a spacial or mental map of what is being viewed indirectly.
- Saccade means we pick up on certain things as more important.
- For instance moving objects and bright colours, which come from natural instincts of the hunter gatherer.
- One theory for circles having more draw is that faces and eyes are circular, and our brains are programmed to try and recognize them.
- When aligning circles against a straight edge we need to align circles slightly outside of the straight edge to compensate for our brains interpreting misalignment.
- Diagonals are very dynamic, although they are not used much on the web.

### 2.5. Scale & Cropping

- Scale is so simple but so effective.
- If we change the scale of an image it can become a piece of the layout or grid.
- We can crop and scale images in unusual ways to turn something dull into something very interesting.

### 2.6. Grid

- For learning about grid layout the best book is [Making and Breaking the Grid](https://www.amazon.es/Making-Breaking-Second-Updated-Expanded/dp/163159284X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&dchild=1&keywords=Making+and+Breaking+the+Grid&qid=1602603331&sr=8-1).
- It is really important to understand grids.
- When creating with grids we are anchoring things to one another.
- If we have many different elements, they all have a thing that they lock to.
- Without this anchoring a design can feel disorganized and chaotic.
- It provides a systematic order to layout; _the architecture of space_.
- But if a design is too systematic it is too predictable, so the art is to break the grid a little bit.

## 3. Layout in CSS

- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com) by Rachel Andrew is a great resource with a lot of starting patterns.
- [The Experimental Layout Lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com) by Jen Simmons is a good demonstration of innovative layouts.
- Use DevTools to play around with the layout demos to learn how they are put together.
- [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com) is another good learning tool.
- [The CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app) can help with starting off too.

## 4. Colour Theory

### 4.1. Colour Modes

- There is additive and subtractive colour mixing.
- CMYK is a subtractive process because we are basically subtracting white. CMY mixed together make black (K).
- Additive colour mixing is red, green and blue and when all mixed together make white.
- RGB is for the screen and CMYK is for print.

### 4.2. Colour Mixing

- There is a colour wheel which can be used to combine colours in different ways.
- Examples are:
  - Monochromatic: Same colour
  - Complementary: Opposites on the colour wheel
  - Analogous: Next to each other
  - Triadic: Triangular on the colour wheel
- One of the reasons colour is so difficult is because a colour is only a colour in relation to another colour.
- Something that seems blue might look more turquoise or green next to another blue.
- Contrast is very important for accessibility.
- There are some great tools for this like [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com).
- The best tool for playing with colour is from [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

### 4.3. Colour Modes & Properties

- In real life whatever colour the light shines on, the shadow is the opposite side of the colour wheel.
- Things that are far away will have low contrast and blurry, and things close will have will be vibrant and sharp.

### 4.4. Colour in Code

- RGBA uses numbers from 0-255 or RGB and 0-1 for A.
- Hex uses values from 0-9 and A-F, 0 being the lowest value and and F being the highest.
- HSLA uses numbers from 0-360 for H, 0%-100% for SL and 0-1 for A.
- The Hue in HSLA represents the colour wheel, and therefore is the most intuative. HSLA can do generative colours without limitations.

### 4.5. Colour Variables

- Colour variables keep things consistent across our application.

```css
:root {
  --brandColor: red;
}

body {
  background: var(--brandColor);
}

/* Sass */
$brandColor: red;

body {
  background: $brandColor;
}
```

### 4.6. Limited Colour

- When first starting out we should limit our colour palette.
- This keeps things consistent and later we can add more.
- Try starting with 3 colours, then 5, then 6.

### 4.7. Colour Tools

- On Dribbble we can steal palettes.
- We can also click on one of the colours and bring up a spectrum of designs that work within the colour palette.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) is a great resource for generating colour palettes.
- [Paletton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) is another option.
- [Adobe Capture](https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html) captures colours from photos using ML.
- [The Ultimate CSS Gradient Generator](https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/) is an old tool but a good one for gradients.
- [UIGradients](https://uigradients.com/#BlueSkies) is like Coolors for gradients.

### 4.8. Animated Gradients

- Just trying to apply animations to gradients will cause a lot of performance issues.
- Sarah has created an [animated transparent mask](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/akAWPR/) to create an animated gradient effect.

### 4.9. How to Create a Colour Palette

- Start with one colour and anchor the palette to it.
- Find more energetic versions and more corporate versions of that one brand colour.
- Decrease the saturation to get the greys.
- Then find a nice accent colour or two.

### 4.10. Data Visualization with HSLA

- [Here](https://ich.unesco.org/dive/biome/?language=en) is a great example of generative colours with HSLA.

## 5. Typography

- Typographical balances are really important for meaning.
- Typography creates hierarchy.
- Serif has curlicues and sans-serif does not.

### 5.1. Typography Resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com)
- [Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com)
- [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) - analyzer.
- [Hoefler&Co](https://www.typography.com)

### 5.2. Pairing Fonts

- We pair typography using two fonts for a website.
- Never use more than three fonts: it negatively affects design and performance.
- Don't choose types that are too similar to each other.
- Even using two fonts we can change up letter spacing and use caps to create different effects.
- Google fonts has a pairing feature.
- [FontJoy](https://fontjoy.com) is great for finding pairs.
- [Typography for Lawyers](https://www.amazon.es/Typography-Lawyers-Matthew-Butterick/dp/1598390775) is a recommended book.

### 5.3. Typographic Colour

- Typographic colour is the rhythm and cadence of typography.
- This matters for things like body text.
- If we blur our eyes the text should have an even tone, and many darker parts.
- Responsive typography: Mike Riethmuller invented a formula for fluid typography: see [CodePen](https://codepen.io/MadeByMike/).
- We can do creative things with placement of text using [Type Lock-Up](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/text-lock-up/).

### 5.4. Terminology

- We know of monospaced fonts as developers, but many do not the opposite which is proportional.
- Kerning is the space between letters.
- Leading is the space between baselines.
- Widows are when there is one word that is left alone at the end of a paragraph.
- Orphans are when the end of a paragraph is left alone at the start of the next paragraph.
- Ligatures are when letters join together.
- [More typography terminology](https://creativemarket.com/blog/typography-terms-cheatsheet?utm_source=Link&utm_medium=CM+Social+Share&utm_campaign=Blog+Post+Social+Share&utm_content=Free+Typography+Basics+Cheatsheet%3A+Anatomy%2C+Classification+%26+Special+Terms+%7E+Creative+Market+Blog&ts=201811).
- Text always has a bigger space at the bottom in books. If it is centred, it looks like the text is _falling down_.

### 5.5. Summary

- Always pay close attention to font performance. Use [Zach Leatherman's blog](https://www.zachleat.com/web/) as a guide.
- Peter Meuller took some of Zach's advise and made an automation tool called [Subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont).
- Robin Rendle has a great [blog](https://www.robinrendle.com/adventures/) about typography.
