## 1. Introduction

- [Slides](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers/blob/master/slides-pdf/Des4Dev2.pdf).
- [Repo](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers).

### 1.1. Right Brain vs Left Brain

- This is a total myth! There are a tonne of [resources](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222) that debunk this.
- People convince them selves that they cannot do something.
- The brain must doesn't work like this. There is no one thing that keeps you from being good at another.
- The more you use your brain in different types of ways, he stringer it becomes.
- So the more we learn outside of our own discipline, the better we become at our discipline.

### 1.2. What this Course Is

- This course aims to touch all foundational topics of design, with resources to delve deeper.
- The directory structure is recommended for working on side projects: insp(iration), src for image and font sources, and dev for the eventual repo.
- Also it is a good structure to see a project through from start to finish, with everything at east access.

### 1.3. Perfection

- When we first start designing, things don't always turn out how we would like them to.
- It is OK, sometimes it takes a few bad designs to arrive at a good one.
- Keep trying, keep working on it, and we will get there.
- We grow by making mistakes and learning from them.
