## 1. Introduction

- [Slides](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers/blob/master/slides-pdf/Des4Dev2.pdf).
- [Repo](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers).

### 1.1. Right Brain vs Left Brain

- This is a total myth! There are a tonne of [resources](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222) that debunk this.
- People convince them selves that they cannot do something.
- The brain must doesn't work like this. There is no one thing that keeps you from being good at another.
- The more you use your brain in different types of ways, he stringer it becomes.
- So the more we learn outside of our own discipline, the better we become at our discipline.

### 1.2. What this Course Is

- This course aims to touch all foundational topics of design, with resources to delve deeper.
- The directory structure is recommended for working on side projects: insp(iration), src for image and font sources, and dev for the eventual repo.
- Also it is a good structure to see a project through from start to finish, with everything at east access.

### 1.3. Perfection

- When we first start designing, things don't always turn out how we would like them to.
- It is OK, sometimes it takes a few bad designs to arrive at a good one.
- Keep trying, keep working on it, and we will get there.
- We grow by making mistakes and learning from them.

## 2. Layout

- Grids is an old concept for layout which brings order to chaos.
- When we are constructing disparate things, using a grid helps the mind focus and navigate a space.
- Like ancient city plans we as humans have always thought about using grids as a system to find things.
- We can also play around with the entire base concept of the layout with just a few blocks.
- This helps our mind compartmentalize and problem solve.

### 2.1. Balance: Symmetry

- Something can be harmonious by being mirrored on both sides.
- We can start to break symmetry to keep the rhythm in our eye moving around.
- The good thing about symmetry is that if we do break it, the viewers eye goes straight to that point.
- This is a great way to draw attention to something.
- Things can get boring with too much symmetry.

### 2.2. Balance: Asymmetry

- Asymmetry isn't used as much because it is harder to do.
- Creating balance in an asymmetrical canvas can be more tricky.
- Asymmetry asks for more care when balancing things, rather than just alignment we need to be more thoughtful.
- People gravitate towards asymmetry more in terms of preference, probably because the world is not perfectly symmetrical.

### 2.3. Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History

- In photography, the rule of thirds is when we break a composition down into thirds and place the key part in one of the thirds.
- Triad composition uses triangles to draw the eye and prevent it from leaving the canvas.
- Swiss Design is famous for using large flat geometric shapes, using, making and breaking grids very cleanly.

### 2.4. Shape

- Circles draw the eye more than other shapes.
- There is an idea called Saccade where even when looking at something the eye is making a spacial or mental map of what is being viewed indirectly.
- Saccade means we pick up on certain things as more important.
- For instance moving objects and bright colours, which come from natural instincts of the hunter gatherer.
- One theory for circles having more draw is that faces and eyes are circular, and our brains are programmed to try and recognize them.
- When aligning circles against a straight edge we need to align circles slightly outside of the straight edge to compensate for our brains interpreting misalignment.
- Diagonals are very dynamic, although they are not used much on the web.

### 2.5. Scale & Cropping

- Scale is so simple but so effective.
- If we change the scale of an image it can become a piece of the layout or grid.
- We can crop and scale images in unusual ways to turn something dull into something very interesting.

### 2.6. Grid

- For learning about grid layout the best book is [Making and Breaking the Grid](https://www.amazon.es/Making-Breaking-Second-Updated-Expanded/dp/163159284X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&dchild=1&keywords=Making+and+Breaking+the+Grid&qid=1602603331&sr=8-1).
- It is really important to understand grids.
- When creating with grids we are anchoring things to one another.
- If we have many different elements, they all have a thing that they lock to.
- Without this anchoring a design can feel disorganized and chaotic.
- It provides a systematic order to layout; _the architecture of space_.
- But if a design is too systematic it is too predictable, so the art is to break the grid a little bit.

## 3. Layout in CSS

- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com) by Rachel Andrew is a great resource with a lot of starting patterns.
- [The Experimental Layout Lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com) by Jen Simmons is a good demonstration of innovative layouts.
- Use DevTools to play around with the layout demos to learn how they are put together.
- [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com) is another good learning tool.
- [The CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app) can help with starting off too.
