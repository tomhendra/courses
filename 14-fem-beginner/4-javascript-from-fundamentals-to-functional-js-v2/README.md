<h1>JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2</h1>
</div>

- [1. Introduction](#1-introduction)

## 1. Introduction

Learn higher-order functions, closures, scope, master key functional methods like map, reduce and filter and promises and ES6+ asynchronous JavaScript. [Course Link](hhttps://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/).

- Strengthen your understanding of tricky JS concepts:

  - Understanding how to use functional utility methods.
  - Understanding how to implement those methods.
  - Applying JS fundamentals throughout the process.
  - Adding some related ES6 features.

- What is Functional Programming?

  - A programming style that's trending.
  - It's expected that you can read and write code in this style.
  - Functional utility methods come free with JS.
  - It's about breaking your code up into verbs, as opposed to OOP being about nouns.
  - It's easier to think about objects as humans, but FP is about actions (verbs).
  - Involves lots of pure functions that perform actions on things.
  - One of the core tenets is creating pure functions that don't have side effects.
  - A pure function has an input and output and can't do anything or affect any other data outside the scope of that function.
  - Makes code a lot easier to test & trust.
  - However with web side effects are unavoidable - DOM manipulation creates side effects so 100% purely functional is not possible.
