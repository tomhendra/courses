## 1. Introduction

An introduction to JavaScript with Kyle Simpson, of YDKJS.
[Course Link](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/).

### 1.1. Course Overview

- Programming primer (in JS)
- Three pillars of JS:

  1. Types / Coercion
  2. Scope / Closures
  3. This / Prototypes

### 1.2. Code is for Humans

- [Video link](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/kyle-simpson/code-is-for-humans/).
- We write code so that it is readable to human beings.
- A systemic problem in software development is that developers don't understand why code works.
- Developers are professional guessers!
- If you don't know how your code works, you have no hope of fixing it when it breaks (Getify's Law #42).
- Ego often drives devs to say "it'd be faster if I just rewrote it".
- The inability to understand code to the extent you have to rewrite it is a universal, systemic problem.
- The difficulty of understanding code comes directly from out inability and unwillingness to insist that the code communicates our ideas.
- Problem: We write code primarily for the computer, but that's not who source code is for.
- There are an infinite number of ways to write the same program, but what metric do we use to measure the 'best' way?
- The program is just a suggestion to the computer.
- Primary purpose: Code is for communicating ideas with other people.
- The best metric for code quality is effective communication of your ideas so that it survives the "it'd be faster if I just rewrote it" cycle.
- Make your code so understandable that another person can figure out what you were thinking and spot and correct a mistake causing a bug. This is rare!
- Code that you do not understand is code that you cannot trust, and code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand.
- Why re we always optimizing for writability instead of readability?
- As much as 70% of our time spent coding is spent reading the code.
- Code must first be ready before it can be written.
- **Warning:** If your code has to be rewritten to be fixed, improved or extended, you failed.
- Dedicate 10% if your time (6 minutes in every hour) to refactor your code to be more readable.
- Documentation and tests are important, but ultimately they are **indirectly** related to code quality.
- Readability **directly** impacts your ability, and that of everyone else, to do their job.
- Every single moment you invest in making your code more readable is time saved in the future.
- The one thing we will always be better at than the computer: Empathetic communication with other people (Getify's Law #1).
- Understanding your tools is how you communicate your ideas more effectively through code.
