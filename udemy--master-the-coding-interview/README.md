## Getting More Interviews

Key takeaway to write at the end

- The more interviews you get, the better your chances are to get a great job.
- Practising interview skills is key to performing well in interviews.

- If you applying to 100 jobs and only getting one interview, you're probably doing something wrong.

### Resumes

- Make the resume personal to each job you apply to so you have the company name on resume.
- Use online tools to generate well designed resume. Your time is better spent writing code!
- Companies often use algorithms to search for keywords from the job listing.
- key points for resume:
  - should be one page only.

  - GitHub: Make commits. Contribute to open source.
  - Website: Doesn't need to be complicated.
  - 1-2 big projects: Big, challenging projects much better than numerous simple ones.
  - Blog

  - 3. Include keywords recruiters are looking for from the jobs you are applying for.
