## 1. Introduction

Design systems increase the speed of development across teams, as well as make your applications look and feel consistent. In this course, you'll create a design system from scratch and learn the foundational design concepts that go into one. You'll design your components using Figma, then take those designs and turn them into coded components using React. Finally, you'll animate those components, document them with Storybook, and deploy your Storybook application so you can share it with your team!
