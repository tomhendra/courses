## Why Integrate Jira and Confluence

- Single source of project knowledge: Increase productivity by avoiding overlapping, scattered and out-of-sync information.
- Improve the team's shared understanding of the project: Provide information to team members from the application they use.
- Maintain traceability: Organized, complete history of project work, conversations, discussions etc.

- Agile projects involve continuous change and planning - integration enables the project information to be _living_.

- Teams can use the strengths of Confluence for knowledge management, and the strengths of Jira for work management.

### Administration Overview

- In Confluence you have a number of pages, which are organized into spaces.
- In Jira you have a number of issues, which are organized into projects.

#### Jira & Confluence Administration Tasks

- Connect Jira & Confluence instances (Jira & Confluence admins).
- Create Confluence spaces (Confluence admin).
- Assign Confluence space administrators (Confluence admin).
- Create Jira projects (usually Jira admin).
- Assign project administrators and leads (usually Jira admin).
- Create a link between a Confluence space and Jira project (Jira or Confluence admin).

### Notes

- Every agile team is unique and always changing. There often is no "right way" to use the applications.
- Use the Jira and Confluence tools to reflect your team's current processes, not dictate them.

### Takeaways

- Issue management (Jira) and content creation and collaboration (Confluence) are essential to most projects.
- Integrate Jira and Confluence to inform and involve the entire team from a single source of truth.
- Integrating Jira and Confluence improves shared understanding, team satisfaction and productivity.

## Linking Issues and Pages

### Add links to Pages in Issues.

- In the details of a Jira issue you can link to a Confluence page.
- This is an easy way to reference information to the Jira issue.
- Can navigate directly to the Confluence page.
- Changes to the pages location or title are automatically reflected.

### Add links to Issues on Pages

- On Confluence pages you can add links to related Jira issues.
- Creates a convenient link to the issue.
- Automatically provides the current status of the issue (a living document).
- Automatically adds a link to the page in the issue links section of the Jira issue.
- To link to a Jira issue on a Confluence page, you can use the Jira Issue/Filter Macro.
  - Edit a Confluence page.
  - +(insert more content).
  - Jira Issue/Filter Macro.
  - Search for the issue: use any issue key, search URL, Jira link, JQL, plain text or filter.
  - Configure display options.
  - Click insert.
- Another option apart from using the Jira Issue/Filter Macro is to paste the URL of a Jira issue on the Confluence page.
  - This triggers the auto-convert feature in Confluence, so the link on the page looks the same as if using the Jira Issue/Filter Macro.

### Takeaways

- Jira and Confluence have out-of-the-box linking capabilities.
- Changes to linked pages or issues are automatically reflected in the links.
- In Jira, use the link feature of Jira issues to link to Confluence pages.
