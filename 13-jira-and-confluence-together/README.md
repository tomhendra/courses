- Agile projects involve continuous change and planning - integration enables the project information to be _living_.

- Teams can use the strengths of Confluence for knowledge management, and the strengths of Jira for work management.

### Administration Overview

### Notes

- Every agile team is unique and always changing. There often is no "right way" to use the applications.
- Use the Jira and Confluence tools to reflect your team's current processes, not dictate them.
