<h1>Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning</h1>
<p>Notes from the course.</p>
</div>

## Introduction

This course aims to teach you how to be an efficient learner. As recommended in the course, notes should be taken throughout to solidify retention of the topics covered. This a **[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/)**. by Andrei Neagoie

The course starts with an introduction to a fun technique, memory palace, where you choose a memorable place such as your home, and imagine a scenario or story that you can link to the topics you are trying to learn. The example elaborates with using a [deck of cards](https://deck.of.cards/) to remember the first 10, and works remarkably well.

The course has four main sections:

1. Principles
2. Pillars
3. Lies
4. Techniques.

## 1. Principles

Useful principles & guidelines to being a self-motivated learner.

- Learning vs Winning the system: Being smart doesn't automatically lead to success.
- Shift focus from getting the best result (good grades, promotion) to a long-term learning mindset.
- Being an efficient learner is great, but to succeed you need drive & persistence.
- Embrace obstacles. If it is hard then you are progressing, nobody is successful from the start.
- The dip: There will be times when you feel you'll never 'get it'. Push through those times.
- Compound learning: Learn in small bites, rather than all day sessions.
- Failures don't count against us. People remember us for where we are now, not what we were when we failed.
- The more failures we have, the more feedback we have to improve.
- Choice vs chore: Shift focus on learning from "I must to" to "I want to" in order to grow.
- Use frames to change view / perspective. Instead of "I can't do this", think "I am improving at this".
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule. Eliminate from 100% until you reach the 20% which will give 80% of results.
- What are the critical skills that will give you the 80% of results. Focus on those.
- Skill stacking: 3 approaches to career strategy:
  1. Curiosity. Innate ambition to learn continuously.
  2. Value learning above all else. Choose a job where everyone is smarter than you, over high salary.
  3. Gathering and combining skills in a unique way.
- The most valuable skills to stack are ones that are compatible, but different enough to make you stand out.
- Monitor the things in life that make you happy. You will learn more effectively when you're happy.
- Identify Happiness factors and keep them in check every few months.
- Your productivity time: Learn in the time of the day you are productive.
- Self-learning paradigm: Using everything on this list so far, find your motivation from within.

## 2. Lies

Popular myths debunked.

- Follow your passion:
  - Learning a valuable skill, getting smarter & gaining recognition makes a career enjoyable.
  - You don't have to be passionate about it, you just need to have an interest in it.
  - Creativity, control and impact combined with a valuable skill set makes the passion arise.
  - Craftsman mindset: How can I improve and offer something uniquely valuable. Work hard, get good.
- You can avoid risk:
  - To achieve success, learn to tolerate and enjoy taking risks.
  - When you notice butterflies in your stomach, you are doing something worthwhile. Embrace them.
  - View risks as challenges to look forward to.
  - You need risk to make exceptional discoveries or leaps in skill.
- Trust this one person:
  - Don't believe leaders alone.
  - Look at unique sources and combine opinions.
  - Don't get all your information from one source.
  - Form your own opinions and thoughts.
- 10,000 hours rule:
  - Practice matters, but the 10,000 hour rule has been debunked.
  - Truth is that there are more factors to consider.
  - Everyone has advantages and disadvantages.
  - Efficient learning is better than hard learning.

## 3. Pillars

Four pillars of foundations for implementing learning techniques.

1. Everything is a game:
   - Allows 2 things to happen in our minds
   - 1. Growth mindset: Talent / intelligence aren't just gifts, they can be learned with effort and strategy.
   - 2. Locus of control: To improve skills we need to accept responsibility that we control outcomes, rather than blaming external factors when things go unfavourably.
2. Feynman technique:
   - In order to really know a topic, you need to be able to teach it.
   - Bring down a concept to its basic level.
   - Being able to explain a topic in simple terms is the best way to learn.
3. Trunk based knowledge:
   - In order to be successful, we need to start at the trunk before we get to the leaves.
   - Start with the principles, the fundamentals, before moving to more detailed topics.
4. Efficiency trumps grit:
   - Being busy is seen as a good thing in society, but in reality it means you lack time management skills.
   - By using the right strategies and methods, & learning the right topics, you are learning efficiently.
