<h1>Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning</h1>
<p>Notes from the course.</p>
</div>

## Introduction

This course aims to teach you how to be an efficient learner. As recommended in the course, notes should be taken throughout to solidify retention of the topics covered. This a **[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/)**. by Andrei Neagoie

The course starts with an introduction to a fun technique, memory palace, where you choose a memorable place such as your home, and imagine a scenario or story that you can link to the topics you are trying to learn. The example elaborates with using a [deck of cards](https://deck.of.cards/) to remember the first 10, and works remarkably well.

The course has four main sections:

1. Principles
2. Pillars
3. Lies
4. Techniques.

## 1. Principles

Useful principles & guidelines to being a self-motivated learner.

- Learning vs Winning the system: Being smart doesn't automatically lead to success.
- Shift focus from getting the best result (good grades, promotion) to a long-term learning mindset.
- Being an efficient learner is great, but to succeed you need drive & persistence.
- Embrace obstacles. If it is hard then you are progressing, nobody is successful from the start.
- The dip: There will be times when you feel you'll never 'get it'. Push through those times.
- Compound learning: Learn in small bites, rather than all day sessions.
- Failures don't count against us. People remember us for where we are now, not what we were when we failed.
- The more failures we have, the more feedback we have to improve.
- Choice vs chore: Shift focus on learning from "I must to" to "I want to" in order to grow.
- Use frames to change view / perspective. Instead of "I can't do this", think "I am improving at this".
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule. Eliminate from 100% until you reach the 20% which will give 80% of results.
- What are the critical skills that will give you the 80% of results. Focus on those.
- Skill stacking: 3 approaches to career strategy:
  1. Curiosity. Innate ambition to learn continuously.
  2. Value learning above all else. Choose a job where everyone is smarter than you, over high salary.
  3. Gathering and combining skills in a unique way.
- The most valuable skills to stack are ones that are compatible, but different enough to make you stand out.
- Monitor the things in life that make you happy. You will learn more effectively when you're happy.
- Identify Happiness factors and keep them in check every few months.
- Your productivity time: Learn in the time of the day you are productive.
- Self-learning paradigm: Using everything on this list so far, find your motivation from within.

## 2. Lies

Popular myths debunked.

### - Follow your passion:

- Learning a valuable skill, getting smarter & gaining recognition makes a career enjoyable.
- You don't have to be passionate about it, you just need to have an interest in it.
- Creativity, control and impact combined with a valuable skill set makes the passion arise.
- Craftsman mindset: How can I improve and offer something uniquely valuable. Work hard, get good.

### - You can avoid risk:

- To achieve success, learn to tolerate and enjoy taking risks.
- When you notice butterflies in your stomach, you are doing something worthwhile. Embrace them.
- View risks as challenges to look forward to.
- You need risk to make exceptional discoveries or leaps in skill.

### - Trust this one person:

- Don't believe leaders alone.
- Look at unique sources and combine opinions.
- Don't get all your information from one source.
- Form your own opinions and thoughts.

### - 10,000 hours rule:

- Practice matters, but the 10,000 hour rule has been debunked.
- Truth is that there are more factors to consider.
- Everyone has advantages and disadvantages.
- Efficient learning is better than hard learning.

## 3. Pillars

Four pillars of foundations for implementing learning techniques.

1. Everything is a game:
   - Allows 2 things to happen in our minds
   - 1. Growth mindset: Talent / intelligence aren't just gifts, they can be learned with effort and strategy.
   - 2. Locus of control: To improve skills we need to accept responsibility that we control outcomes, rather than blaming external factors when things go unfavourably.
2. Feynman technique:
   - In order to really know a topic, you need to be able to teach it.
   - Bring down a concept to its basic level.
   - Being able to explain a topic in simple terms is the best way to learn.
3. Trunk based knowledge:
   - In order to be successful, we need to start at the trunk before we get to the leaves.
   - Start with the principles, the fundamentals, before moving to more detailed topics.
4. Efficiency trumps grit:
   - Being busy is seen as a good thing in society, but in reality it means you lack time management skills.
   - By using the right strategies and methods, & learning the right topics, you are learning efficiently.

## 4. Science

The science on which efficient learning foundations are based.

- Focus vs Diffuse Learning: Efficient learning is accomplished by moving between both modes.
- Multitasking is usually a bad strategy, and causes dual tsk interference where cognitive efficiency depletes.
- Sleep is extremely important for long term learning. Flushes toxins and forms new neural connections.
- Brain training strengthens the connections (synapses) between brain cells (neurons).
- Physical exercise is very important for encouraging diffuse mode of thinking.
- Feedback is integral to learning, both positive and negative, however criticism is more effective, and immediate feedback is best.
- Procrastination: everyone has to deal with it. The key is to manage emotion rather than time.
- To overcome procrastination you need to make a start on the task; take the the first step.
- Long & short term memory: Long term memory is where fundamental principles are stored, formed my practising and repeating.
- Short term / working memory generally consists of 4 chunks of information. Spaced repetition used to ensure memory is transformed into long term by strengthening synapses.
- Active vs passive learning: Active engagement is more effective than passive learning.
- Passively watching videos creates illusion of competence.
- Need to practice what you have learned through actually doing. Retrieval is better than re-reading.
- Intrinsic motivation comes from within, what we want to do. Extrinsic motivation come from outside of us.
- Three factors for intrinsic drive: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose.
- Small steps for goals eliminate fear of failure.
- S.M.A.R.T. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
- It pays not to be busy: Healthy leisurely time is crucial. Taking breaks means more efficient learning.
- Chunking: Combine chunks of knowledge (bottom up learning). The connections between chunks (top down learning) combined with the chunks themselves, create knowledge.
- How to solve problems: 2 ways: Within focus mode & within diffuse mode (intuition).
- Deliberate practice: Pushing past the perceived limit once plateau us reached. Concentrate on things just outside of your abilities.
- Four things required:
  1. Specific goals
  2. Intense focus
  3. Immediate feedback
  4. Frequent discomfort
- Spaced repetition: Best way to strengthen the synaptic neurons, create long term memory.
- Energy saving with habits: Not having to focus on something saves energy.
- We remember things better in an adventurous state, when doing something new or experimenting.
- Have an endpoint: Establish a time to finish a focussed learning session.
- Be bored: Allows diffuse mode to happen.

## 5. Techniques

Proven techniques for efficient learning.

### 1. Pomodoro technique

- 25 mins of focused continuous work followed by 5 mins of rest in diffuse mode.
- Always start with the task that you least want to do, or the hardest.
- Helps with procrastination.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), there are six steps:

1.  Decide on the task to be done.
2.  Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3.  Work on the task.
4.  End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5.  If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6.  After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

### 2. Chunk the subject

- Combine smaller pieces of information to gain knowledge of a subject.
- A popular method for cracking particular algorithm challenges is the [Divide and Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) method.
- Break down larger complex things into simpler chunks.
- Write 1 page to summarize everything in a subject. If it doesn't fit on one side of paper, you haven't chunked enough.

### 3. Spaced repetition

- The only way to create long term memories.
- Used varied techniques for spaced repetition
- Repetitive over-learning can cause the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)
- Recalling and retrieving information causes reconciliation which strengthens the neural synapses (connections)
- This is why the Feynman technique works so well.
- Diagrams are a good way to enhance spaced repetition.
