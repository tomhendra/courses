<h1>Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning</h1>
<p>Notes from the course.</p>
</div>

## Introduction

This course aims to teach you how to be an efficient learner. As recommended in the course, notes should be taken throughout to solidify retention of the topics covered. This a **[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/)**. by Andrei Neagoie

The course starts with an introduction to a fun technique, memory palace, where you choose a memorable place such as your home, and imagine a scenario or story that you can link to the topics you are trying to learn. The example elaborates with using a [deck of cards](https://deck.of.cards/) to remember the first 10, and works remarkably well.

The course has four main sections:

1. Principles
2. Pillars
3. Lies
4. Techniques.

## 1. Principles

Useful principles & guidelines to being a self-motivated learner.

- Learning vs Winning the system: Being smart doesn't automatically lead to success.
- Shift focus from getting the best result (good grades, promotion) to a long-term learning mindset.
- Reference: [The Lesson to Unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html)
- Being an efficient learner is great, but to succeed you need drive & persistence.
- Embrace obstacles. If it is hard then you are progressing, nobody is successful from the start.
- The dip: There will be times when you feel you'll never 'get it'. Push through those times.
- Compound learning: Learn in small bites, rather than all day sessions.
- Failures don't count against us. People remember us for where we are now, not what we were when we failed.
- The more failures we have, the more feedback we have to improve.
- Choice vs chore: Shift focus on learning from "I must to" to "I want to" in order to grow.
- Use frames to change view / perspective. Instead of "I can't do this", think "I am improving at this".
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule. Eliminate from 100% until you reach the 20% which will give 80% of results.
- What are the critical skills that will give you the 80% of results. Focus on those.
- Skill stacking: 3 approaches to career strategy:
  1. Curiosity. Innate ambition to learn continuously.
  2. Value learning above all else. Choose a job where everyone is smarter than you, over high salary.
  3. Gathering and combining skills in a unique way.
- The most valuable skills to stack are ones that are compatible, but different enough to make you stand out.
- Monitor the things in life that make you happy. You will learn more effectively when you're happy.
- Identify Happiness factors and keep them in check every few months.
- Your productivity time: Learn in the time of the day you are productive.
- Self-learning paradigm: Using everything on this list so far, find your motivation from within.
