## Introduction

This course aims to teach you how to be an efficient learner. As recommended in the course, notes should be taken throughout to solidify retention of the topics covered. This a **[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/)**. by Andrei Neagoie

The course starts with an introduction to a fun technique, memory palace, where you choose a memorable place such as your home, and imagine a scenario or story that you can link to the topics you are trying to learn. The example elaborates with using a [deck of cards](https://deck.of.cards/) to remember the first 10, and works remarkably well.

The course has four main sections:

1. Principles
2. Pillars
3. Lies
4. Techniques.
