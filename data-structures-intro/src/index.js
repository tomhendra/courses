// - Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
// - Different data structures excel at different things.  Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
// - Working with map/location data? -- Use a graph!
// - Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? -- Use a linked list!
// - Web scraping nested HTML? -- Use a tree!
// - Need to write a scheduler? -- Use a binary heap!
