eslint out of the box doesn't understand react very well, so the following plugins assist...

babel-eslint - allows eslint to be augmented by babel
eslint-plugin-import - provides some new rules around importing and exporting things
eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y - accessibility plugin to help catch easy accessibility wins
eslint-plugin-react - additional react rules that we need
eslint-plugin-react-hooks - official rules from the React team about writing hooks
