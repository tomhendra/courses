/*

Two different systems inside of TypeScript which apply differently to variable declarations, functions & objects.

1) Type annotations = Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to
2) Type inference = TypeScript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to, if
   declaration & initialization are on the same line e.g. const color = 'red'

WHen to use type inference...
- ALWAYS!
