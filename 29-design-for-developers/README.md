## 1. Introduction

This is part of the Frontend Masters Design to Code Track.

- [Slides](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers/blob/master/slides-pdf/Des4Dev2.pdf).
- [Repo](https://github.com/sdras/design-for-developers).

### 1.1. Right Brain vs Left Brain

- This is a total myth! There are a tonne of [resources](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222) that debunk this.
- People convince them selves that they cannot do something.
- The brain must doesn't work like this. There is no one thing that keeps you from being good at another.
- The more you use your brain in different types of ways, he stringer it becomes.
- So the more we learn outside of our own discipline, the better we become at our discipline.

### 1.2. What this Course Is

- This course aims to touch all foundational topics of design, with resources to delve deeper.
- The directory structure is recommended for working on side projects: insp(iration), src for image and font sources, and dev for the eventual repo.
- Also it is a good structure to see a project through from start to finish, with everything at east access.

### 1.3. Perfection

- When we first start designing, things don't always turn out how we would like them to.
- It is OK, sometimes it takes a few bad designs to arrive at a good one.
- Keep trying, keep working on it, and we will get there.
- We grow by making mistakes and learning from them.

## 2. Layout

- Grids is an old concept for layout which brings order to chaos.
- When we are constructing disparate things, using a grid helps the mind focus and navigate a space.
- Like ancient city plans we as humans have always thought about using grids as a system to find things.
- We can also play around with the entire base concept of the layout with just a few blocks.
- This helps our mind compartmentalize and problem solve.

### 2.1. Balance: Symmetry

- Something can be harmonious by being mirrored on both sides.
- We can start to break symmetry to keep the rhythm in our eye moving around.
- The good thing about symmetry is that if we do break it, the viewers eye goes straight to that point.
- This is a great way to draw attention to something.
- Things can get boring with too much symmetry.

### 2.2. Balance: Asymmetry

- Asymmetry isn't used as much because it is harder to do.
- Creating balance in an asymmetrical canvas can be more tricky.
- Asymmetry asks for more care when balancing things, rather than just alignment we need to be more thoughtful.
- People gravitate towards asymmetry more in terms of preference, probably because the world is not perfectly symmetrical.

### 2.3. Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from Art History

- In photography, the rule of thirds is when we break a composition down into thirds and place the key part in one of the thirds.
- Triad composition uses triangles to draw the eye and prevent it from leaving the canvas.
- Swiss Design is famous for using large flat geometric shapes, using, making and breaking grids very cleanly.

### 2.4. Shape

- Circles draw the eye more than other shapes.
- There is an idea called Saccade where even when looking at something the eye is making a spacial or mental map of what is being viewed indirectly.
- Saccade means we pick up on certain things as more important.
- For instance moving objects and bright colours, which come from natural instincts of the hunter gatherer.
- One theory for circles having more draw is that faces and eyes are circular, and our brains are programmed to try and recognize them.
- When aligning circles against a straight edge we need to align circles slightly outside of the straight edge to compensate for our brains interpreting misalignment.
- Diagonals are very dynamic, although they are not used much on the web.

### 2.5. Scale & Cropping

- Scale is so simple but so effective.
- If we change the scale of an image it can become a piece of the layout or grid.
- We can crop and scale images in unusual ways to turn something dull into something very interesting.

### 2.6. Grid

- For learning about grid layout the best book is [Making and Breaking the Grid](https://www.amazon.es/Making-Breaking-Second-Updated-Expanded/dp/163159284X/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&dchild=1&keywords=Making+and+Breaking+the+Grid&qid=1602603331&sr=8-1).
- It is really important to understand grids.
- When creating with grids we are anchoring things to one another.
- If we have many different elements, they all have a thing that they lock to.
- Without this anchoring a design can feel disorganized and chaotic.
- It provides a systematic order to layout; _the architecture of space_.
- But if a design is too systematic it is too predictable, so the art is to break the grid a little bit.

## 3. Layout in CSS

- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com) by Rachel Andrew is a great resource with a lot of starting patterns.
- [The Experimental Layout Lab](https://labs.jensimmons.com) by Jen Simmons is a good demonstration of innovative layouts.
- Use DevTools to play around with the layout demos to learn how they are put together.
- [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com) is another good learning tool.
- [The CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app) can help with starting off too.

## 4. Colour Theory

### 4.1. Colour Modes

- There is additive and subtractive colour mixing.
- CMYK is a subtractive process because we are basically subtracting white. CMY mixed together make black (K).
- Additive colour mixing is red, green and blue and when all mixed together make white.
- RGB is for the screen and CMYK is for print.

### 4.2. Colour Mixing

- There is a colour wheel which can be used to combine colours in different ways.
- Examples are:
  - Monochromatic: Same colour
  - Complementary: Opposites on the colour wheel
  - Analogous: Next to each other
  - Triadic: Triangular on the colour wheel
- One of the reasons colour is so difficult is because a colour is only a colour in relation to another colour.
- Something that seems blue might look more turquoise or green next to another blue.
- Contrast is very important for accessibility.
- There are some great tools for this like [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com).
- The best tool for playing with colour is from [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

### 4.3. Colour Modes & Properties

- In real life whatever colour the light shines on, the shadow is the opposite side of the colour wheel.
- Things that are far away will have low contrast and blurry, and things close will have will be vibrant and sharp.

### 4.4. Colour in Code

- RGBA uses numbers from 0-255 or RGB and 0-1 for A.
- Hex uses values from 0-9 and A-F, 0 being the lowest value and and F being the highest.
- HSLA uses numbers from 0-360 for H, 0%-100% for SL and 0-1 for A.
- The Hue in HSLA represents the colour wheel, and therefore is the most intuative. HSLA can do generative colours without limitations.

### 4.5. Colour Variables

- Colour variables keep things consistent across our application.

```css
:root {
  --brandColor: red;
}

body {
  background: var(--brandColor);
}

/* Sass */
$brandColor: red;

body {
  background: $brandColor;
}
```

### 4.6. Limited Colour

- When first starting out we should limit our colour palette.
- This keeps things consistent and later we can add more.
- Try starting with 3 colours, then 5, then 6.

### 4.7. Colour Tools

- On Dribbble we can steal palettes.
- We can also click on one of the colours and bring up a spectrum of designs that work within the colour palette.
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co) is a great resource for generating colour palettes.
- [Paletton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) is another option.
- [Adobe Capture](https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html) captures colours from photos using ML.
- [The Ultimate CSS Gradient Generator](https://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/) is an old tool but a good one for gradients.
- [UIGradients](https://uigradients.com/#BlueSkies) is like Coolors for gradients.

### 4.8. Animated Gradients

- Just trying to apply animations to gradients will cause a lot of performance issues.
- Sarah has created an [animated transparent mask](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/akAWPR/) to create an animated gradient effect.

### 4.9. How to Create a Colour Palette

- Start with one colour and anchor the palette to it.
- Find more energetic versions and more corporate versions of that one brand colour.
- Decrease the saturation to get the greys.
- Then find a nice accent colour or two.

### 4.10. Data Visualization with HSLA

- [Here](https://ich.unesco.org/dive/biome/?language=en) is a great example of generative colours with HSLA.

## 5. Typography

- Typographical balances are really important for meaning.
- Typography creates hierarchy.
- Serif has curlicues and sans-serif does not.

### 5.1. Typography Resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com)
- [Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com)
- [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) - analyzer.
- [Hoefler&Co](https://www.typography.com)

### 5.2. Pairing Fonts

- We pair typography using two fonts for a website.
- Never use more than three fonts: it negatively affects design and performance.
- Don't choose types that are too similar to each other.
- Even using two fonts we can change up letter spacing and use caps to create different effects.
- Google fonts has a pairing feature.
- [FontJoy](https://fontjoy.com) is great for finding pairs.
- [Typography for Lawyers](https://www.amazon.es/Typography-Lawyers-Matthew-Butterick/dp/1598390775) is a recommended book.

### 5.3. Typographic Colour

- Typographic colour is the rhythm and cadence of typography.
- This matters for things like body text.
- If we blur our eyes the text should have an even tone, and many darker parts.
- Responsive typography: Mike Riethmuller invented a formula for fluid typography: see [CodePen](https://codepen.io/MadeByMike/).
- We can do creative things with placement of text using [Type Lock-Up](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/text-lock-up/).

### 5.4. Terminology

- We know of monospaced fonts as developers, but many do not the opposite which is proportional.
- Kerning is the space between letters.
- Leading is the space between baselines.
- Widows are when there is one word that is left alone at the end of a paragraph.
- Orphans are when the end of a paragraph is left alone at the start of the next paragraph.
- Ligatures are when letters join together.
- [More typography terminology](https://creativemarket.com/blog/typography-terms-cheatsheet?utm_source=Link&utm_medium=CM+Social+Share&utm_campaign=Blog+Post+Social+Share&utm_content=Free+Typography+Basics+Cheatsheet%3A+Anatomy%2C+Classification+%26+Special+Terms+%7E+Creative+Market+Blog&ts=201811).
- Text always has a bigger space at the bottom in books. If it is centred, it looks like the text is _falling down_.

### 5.5. Summary

- Always pay close attention to font performance. Use [Zach Leatherman's blog](https://www.zachleat.com/web/) as a guide.
- Peter Meuller took some of Zach's advise and made an automation tool called [Subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont).
- Robin Rendle has a great [blog](https://www.robinrendle.com/adventures/) about typography.

## 6. Inspiration

### 6.1. Remixing

- We can be inspired by someone, but we need to ensure we don't copy them too much.
- Nothing is new in design, but we can combine sources in a unique way to create something that the audience is less accustomed to.
- Everything is a _remix_.
- It is a really good idea to look for inspiration before we start designing.
- Dribbble, Behance, CodePen, Glitch, CodeSandbox.
- Finding our heroes is a good idea.
- Get inspired by multiple sources, throw a load of resources in the insp directory, but then wait.
- Sleep on it and then try to work from memory, not directly.
- It is very hard to copy something if we are not looking at it directly.
- When we stop looking at something for a while, we combine things in our imagination that are unique.
- Look at other disciplines for inspiration. Don't limit to just the web.
- Music, comic books, films, anime - they all can inspire.
- Just like reverse engineering, copying existing work can help us learn.

### 6.2. Sources of Inspiration

- [Give 'n' Go](https://give-n-go.co): Dribble content recreated with code.
- [Swiss Layout](https://codepen.io/sdras/full/oMZjZa): CodePen by Sarah with animated Swiss layout.
- [Vue Invaders](https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne/full/LmrEmb/): CodePen showing grid demo.
- UI Kits on [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com) or [iStock Photo](https://www.istockphoto.com).
- [CodePen Topics](https://codepen.io/topics/): Design patterns for various components.

## 7. Images & Performance

### 7.1. Image Formats & Resources

- We can't be a web performance expert without being an image performance expert.
- Images are really heavy and a huge part of what we transmit on the web.
- There are many resources.
- Free:
  - Unsplash
  - Google Image (Search License)
  - Feepik
  - freeimages
  - Pexels
- Low cost:
  - Creative Market
  - Adobe Stock
- Costly:
  - Shutterstock
  - iStockPhoto
- Sometimes the costly options can be the better option as it is cheaper than paying a designer for 3 hours to find the right images.
- Raster images are bitmap and lose resolution when scaled.
- Vector images are mathematical commands and never loses resolution.
- [Image file formats](https://en.99designs.es/blog/tips/image-file-types/.
- JPG is lossy compression so loses image quality when the it is compressed.
- GIF can be limited in colours to reduce file size.
- PNG have a transparent ability which is good for masking.

### 7.2. Exporting Tips

- If we double the size of the image, compress it as much as possible, then reduce the size to what we want there is almost no notable resolution degradation.
- [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com) and [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) are great for compression. There are also browser extensions and desktop apps.
- Webpack plugins can be used to compress images. Recommended as part of the build process.
- [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) is great for optimizing SVGs.

### 7.3. SVG

- SVG has a canvas like a piece of graph paper, and we can create points on the paper for the browser to draw curves with.
- There are so many ways we can play with SVG.
- It also has a navigable DOM. We can literally put a class on a SVG and manipulate it.
- This means we can also debug int the browser.
- SVG is also super performant.
- Sarah has written [an article](https://css-tricks.com/high-performance-svgs/) about performance tuning with SVG.
- We can even convert non-SVG to SVG like with [this tool](https://codepen.io/shshaw/full/LVKEdv).

### 7.4. SVG Handling & Full Page Background

- We can use SVG to clip things as demonstrated in [this article](https://css-tricks.com/masking-vs-clipping-use/) about clipping vs masking.
- We can clip using two images as demonstrated in [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/noeldelgado/pen/ByxQjL).
- SVG can be used in img tags, as a background source or inline.
- When used inline the DOM can be navigated, so this is the preferred method.
- To save on HTTP requests we can use image sprites and only expose a small section of the sprite (HTTP/2 solves this issue).
- Full page images are still popular. [This article](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/) details best practice.

## 8. Prototyping

### 8.1. Loaders

- Loaders and perceived performance are important because humans overestimate passive wait times by 36%.
- So if we are judging the time a site takes to load, we actually have to multiply that by 0.36.
- Using loaders removed the passive element from waiting, and gives the user something to engage with, reducing perceived wait time.\
- People are willing to wait twice as long for a custom loader experience.
- This is because they assume that someone cares about them, and that they have something to engage with while waiting.
- Uncertain wait times feel longer than known, finite waits.
- Airports make use walk a long way to baggage, theme parks give us wait times and things to engage us when queuing.

### 8.2. User Experience & Tools

- We need to think about what it is like for people to experience what we build.
- [This article](https://css-tricks.com/writing-feature-requirements/) on Writing Feature Requirements helps with this.
- Some large apps feel like the overall end-to-end experience is not cohesive, perhaps as a consequence of multiple product teams owning different parts and not communicating effectively.
- Be a user for our own site.
- Story Maps are another way to anticipate user experience. Check out [this article](https://medium.com/design-story/story-map-3cc64033128e).
- End-to-end website user flows are another way to retain a cohesive UX.
- UI stencils are good for working with pencil and paper to create user flows.

### 8.3. Motion Design Language

- It is also good to create a motion design language for our products.
- Sarah made a [concept on CodePen](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/JbaGwg) to demonstrate.
- By having our own opinions about how motion can work, it gives a brand a specific feel.
- For instance if a brand is brightly coloured and vibrant, bouncy motion could work, whereas something more elegant may benefit from eased motion.

### 8.4. Types of Prototypes

- There are several ways that we can create prototypes:
- Thumbnails: Just for us, for quick and easy iterations.
- Storyboards: One step up from thumbnails in fidelity where we trash ideas and iterate.
- Low-fi: Can communicate a concept without committing with fidelity. See [this example](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/594d891abedf804e87bffe48ee30aace).
- Low-fi with interactivity: Can communicate a gesture without committing resource. See [this example](https://codepen.io/yusufbkr/pen/ORBArk).
- High-fi: More fleshed out. Sarah recommends starting with small pieces and either iterate or create more if the client likes it. See [this example](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/2ae1eadb3a80e26daf3aae54cd148c61).
- We can also screenshot the undeveloped site and just overlay the part we want to demonstrate to the client.

### 8.5. Page Transitions

- Page transitions can come after prototyping.
- A good way to plan them is to take similar components, and from page-to-page change some and leave the rest static.
- [Leo Leung](https://dribbble.com/leoleung) does great motion designs in After Effects on Dribbble for inspiration.
- [Rally](https://rallyinteractive.com/#toyota-experience-center) does great things with motion.
- [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) is a great resource which demonstrates the code as well.
- [Page Flip Layout](https://tympanus.net/Development/PageFlipLayout/) is a good one from Codrops.
- There is something called _flip_ which is used to create performant animations.
- There is a library called [Flipping](https://github.com/davidkpiano/flipping) which is a good way to use this.
- GSAP is another good library for hardware accelerated animations.
