## 1. Introduction

This course aims to teach you how to be an efficient learner. As recommended in the course, notes should be taken throughout to solidify retention of the topics covered. This a **[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/)**. by Andrei Neagoie

The course starts with an introduction to a fun technique, memory palace, where you choose a memorable place such as your home, and imagine a scenario or story that you can link to the topics you are trying to learn. The example elaborates with using a [deck of cards](https://deck.of.cards/) to remember the first 10, and works remarkably well.

The course has four main sections:

1. Principles
2. Lies
3. Pillars
4. Science
5. Techniques.

**[Here is the link to the full course roadmap](https://coggle.it/diagram/Xe6iV4XedHQFQQOJ/t/%F0%9F%94%A5-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery-blueprint-%F0%9F%94%A5/5b1fdfcfdfe6e65371ac91bceb8826e905aa80e6a3e5612383710eaef9390944)**

## 2. Principles

Useful principles & guidelines to being a self-motivated learner.

- Learning vs Winning the system: Being smart doesn't automatically lead to success.
- Shift focus from getting the best result (good grades, promotion) to a long-term learning mindset.
- Being an efficient learner is great, but to succeed you need drive & persistence.
- Embrace obstacles. If it is hard then you are progressing, nobody is successful from the start.
- The dip: There will be times when you feel you'll never 'get it'. Push through those times.
- Compound learning: Learn in small bites, rather than all day sessions.
- Failures don't count against us. People remember us for where we are now, not what we were when we failed.
- The more failures we have, the more feedback we have to improve.
- Choice vs chore: Shift focus on learning from "I must to" to "I want to" in order to grow.
- Use frames to change view / perspective. Instead of "I can't do this", think "I am improving at this".
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule. Eliminate from 100% until you reach the 20% which will give 80% of results.
- What are the critical skills that will give you the 80% of results. Focus on those.
- Skill stacking: 3 approaches to career strategy:
  1. Curiosity. Innate ambition to learn continuously.
  2. Value learning above all else. Choose a job where everyone is smarter than you, over high salary.
  3. Gathering and combining skills in a unique way.
- The most valuable skills to stack are ones that are compatible, but different enough to make you stand out.
- Monitor the things in life that make you happy. You will learn more effectively when you're happy.
- Identify Happiness factors and keep them in check every few months.
- Your productivity time: Learn in the time of the day you are productive.
- Self-learning paradigm: Using everything on this list so far, find your motivation from within.

## 3. Lies

Popular myths debunked.

### 3.1. - Follow your passion:

- Learning a valuable skill, getting smarter & gaining recognition makes a career enjoyable.
- You don't have to be passionate about it, you just need to have an interest in it.
- Creativity, control and impact combined with a valuable skill set makes the passion arise.
- Craftsman mindset: How can I improve and offer something uniquely valuable. Work hard, get good.

### 3.2. - You can avoid risk:

- To achieve success, learn to tolerate and enjoy taking risks.
- When you notice butterflies in your stomach, you are doing something worthwhile. Embrace them.
- View risks as challenges to look forward to.
- You need risk to make exceptional discoveries or leaps in skill.

### 3.3. - Trust this one person:

- Don't believe leaders alone.
- Look at unique sources and combine opinions.
- Don't get all your information from one source.
- Form your own opinions and thoughts.

### 3.4. - 10,000 hours rule:

- Practice matters, but the 10,000 hour rule has been debunked.
- Truth is that there are more factors to consider.
- Everyone has advantages and disadvantages.
- Efficient learning is better than hard learning.

## 4. Pillars

Four pillars of foundations for implementing learning techniques.

1. Everything is a game:
   - Allows 2 things to happen in our minds
   - 1. Growth mindset: Talent / intelligence aren't just gifts, they can be learned with effort and strategy.
   - 2. Locus of control: To improve skills we need to accept responsibility that we control outcomes, rather than blaming external factors when things go unfavourably.
2. Feynman technique:
   - In order to really know a topic, you need to be able to teach it.
   - Bring down a concept to its basic level.
   - Being able to explain a topic in simple terms is the best way to learn.
3. Trunk based knowledge:
   - In order to be successful, we need to start at the trunk before we get to the leaves.
   - Start with the principles, the fundamentals, before moving to more detailed topics.
4. Efficiency trumps grit:
   - Being busy is seen as a good thing in society, but in reality it means you lack time management skills.
   - By using the right strategies and methods, & learning the right topics, you are learning efficiently.

## 5. Science

The science on which efficient learning foundations are based.

- Focus vs Diffuse Learning: Efficient learning is accomplished by moving between both modes.
- Multitasking is usually a bad strategy, and causes dual task interference where cognitive efficiency depletes.
- Sleep is extremely important for long term learning. Flushes toxins and forms new neural connections.
- Brain training strengthens the connections (synapses) between brain cells (neurons).
- Physical exercise is very important for encouraging diffuse mode of thinking.
- Feedback is integral to learning, both positive and negative, however criticism is more effective, and immediate feedback is best.
- Procrastination: everyone has to deal with it. The key is to manage emotion rather than time.
- To overcome procrastination you need to make a start on the task; take the the first step.
- Long & short term memory: Long term memory is where fundamental principles are stored, formed my practising and repeating.
- Short term / working memory generally consists of 4 chunks of information. Spaced repetition used to ensure memory is transformed into long term by strengthening synapses.
- Active vs passive learning: Active engagement is more effective than passive learning.
- Passively watching videos creates illusion of competence.
- Need to practice what you have learned through actually doing. Retrieval is better than re-reading.
- Intrinsic motivation comes from within, what we want to do. Extrinsic motivation come from outside of us.
- Three factors for intrinsic drive: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose.
- Small steps for goals eliminate fear of failure.
- S.M.A.R.T. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound
- It pays not to be busy: Healthy leisurely time is crucial. Taking breaks means more efficient learning.
- Chunking: Combine chunks of knowledge (bottom up learning). The connections between chunks (top down learning) combined with the chunks themselves, create knowledge.
- How to solve problems: 2 ways: Within focus mode & within diffuse mode (intuition).
- Deliberate practice: Pushing past the perceived limit once plateau us reached. Concentrate on things just outside of your abilities.
- Four things required:
  1. Specific goals
  2. Intense focus
  3. Immediate feedback
  4. Frequent discomfort
- Spaced repetition: Best way to strengthen the synaptic neurons, create long term memory.
- Energy saving with habits: Not having to focus on something saves energy.
- We remember things better in an adventurous state, when doing something new or experimenting.
- Have an endpoint: Establish a time to finish a focussed learning session.
- Be bored: Allows diffuse mode to happen.

## 6. Techniques

Proven techniques for efficient learning.

### 6.1. Pomodoro Technique

- 25 mins of focused continuous work followed by 5 mins of rest in diffuse mode.
- Always start with the task that you least want to do, or the hardest.
- Helps with procrastination.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), there are six steps:

1.  Decide on the task to be done.
2.  Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3.  Work on the task.
4.  End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5.  If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6.  After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

### 6.2. Chunk the Subject

- Combine smaller pieces of information to gain knowledge of a subject.
- A popular method for cracking particular algorithm challenges is the [Divide and Conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm) method.
- Break down larger complex things into simpler chunks.
- Write 1 page to summarize everything in a subject. If it doesn't fit on one side of paper, you haven't chunked enough.

### 6.3. Spaced Repetition

- The only way to create long term memories.
- Used varied techniques for spaced repetition
- Repetitive over-learning can cause the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)
- Recalling and retrieving information causes reconciliation which strengthens the neural synapses (connections)
- This is why the Feynman technique works so well.
- Diagrams are a good way to enhance spaced repetition.

### 6.4. Deliberate Practice

- The idea is to avoid the easy stuff, and take on challenging projects.
- Put yourself in situations that challenge you all the time.
- Use focus time daily.
- Push yourself to the edge of your ability, be uncomfortable.
- Always seek immediate feedback.
- Record progress & measure it.

### 6.5. Create a Roadmap

- Mastering a subject requires connections between chunks to be understood.
- Prepare, plan, create a curriculum and execute it.
- Select high quality resources to learn from.
- Focus on industry leaders and what they say.
- What are the most important topics?a
- What type of results do I want to feel recognized and respected?

### 6.6. Interleaving

- Technique to use different problems and sessions to learn something.
- Variety is important.
- Form knowledge from multiple perspectives.

### 6.7. Einstellung

- Einstellung Effect: a rigid mindset that prevents you from expanding your horizons.
- Once you are no longer a beginner, you stop taking feedback as much.
- Constantly explore new ideas to prevent Einstellung effect.
- Sometimes what you learned previously may not be right. Always be open to new concepts.
- What is option C? - You thought of options A and B, but might there be another way?

### 6.8. Importance of Community

- If you don't have a community you will be at a disadvantage.
- Community can provide feedback, find blind spots.
- Motivation from others learning the same thing.
- Accountability from others.
- Be surrounded by people who excel you and propel you to be better.

### 6.9. Habits

- Habits are automatic and don't require concentration, therefore save energy
- The habit loop: 1. Cue (trigger), 2. Routine (ritual) 3. Reward, 4. Belief
- Better to use habits rather than willpower, which is depletable.
- Four laws of behaviour change:

  1. obvious: Is the habit obvious, with roadmap, clear goal.
  2. easy: Is it easy as possible to form this habit?
  3. attractive: Is the outcome attractive to us?
  4. satisfying: Does this habit reward us?

- Build consistency: [Don't break the chain](https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/)

### 6.10. System vs Goals

- Systems are better than goals.
- Success in life usually comes from skills obtained, but also luck.
- Systems can become habits.
- Goal is a rigid objective, system is a way to do something regularly with the expectation of improvement.
- Systems allow us to be flexible and adapt to luck events.
- Goals better for shorter term, systems better for longer term.

### 6.11. Power of the Senses

- Imagery, metaphors, analogies, stories: all help greatly in recall.
- Visual memory and sensual memory help us form strong synapses.
- Adding an emotional element strengthens further.
- Seek new experiences outside of learning to stimulate brain.
- Learn in locations that stimulate your senses.
- Make your study area stimulate your senses.

### 6.12. Method of Loci

- AKA Method of place. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
- Memory enhancement technique using visualization.
- By associations with spacial visualization & stories you can efficiently recall information.

### 6.13. Pareto Principle

- Core 20% gets 80% of results.
- Use the 80/20 rule to prioritise the most important topics to learn.
- Ask yourself: “Is this the best use of my time?“ - “Is this the most critical piece of information?”
- Remove the unnecessary.
- Focus on the 20% of the highest quality, most important.
- Just as important to select as it is to remove.

### 6.14. Parkinson's Law

- Parkinson’s law is the adage that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”. It is sometimes applied to the growth of bureaucracy in an organization. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law)

### 6.15. Deep Work

- Deep intensely focused, highly engaged work or practice.
- No distractions to push your cognitive abilities to their limit.
- Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.
- Shallow work is non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style work, often performed while distracted.

### 6.16. Stakes & Rewards

- Focus on small rewards to stay motivated.
- What happens when you don't achieve your goal? Stakes need to be on the line.
- Hold yourself accountable.
- Stakes are the things that we lose by not achieving our goal.

### 6.17. Concepts vs Facts

- Concepts are more important than facts.
- Facts are easy to Google, concepts need to be learned.
- Recalling something is more effective than repeating something.
- Concepts are high level topics that give you context of what you learn.
- Facts are cheap, anyone can learn them.
- Successful people have concepts to connect the chunks of knowledge to form a novel solution.
- Foundations and principles are important (trunk based knowledge) to form connections of chunks.
- Always ask why to connect the dots.
- Feynman technique is important to explain concepts, and leads to true understanding of a topic.

### 6.18. Test Yourself

- Without practice you will never progress.
- Summarize after learning a topic, recalling information.
- What are the key takeaways? Quiz yourself.
- Creates immediate feedback.
