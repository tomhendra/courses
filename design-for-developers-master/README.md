# Design for Developers

Author: Sarah Drasner

This repo houses the materials and resources for the [Design for Developers course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/) on Frontend Masters. 

Sometimes it seems like designing is an unlearnable skill, or that if you’re a developer, you might not be able to learn it because it’s a different discipline. Luckily, designing has rules just like development does — rules that can be understood both in theory and in practice. In this workshop, learn to how to become self-sufficient for the entire process of execution from concept to design to implementation. This workshop is also ideal for those that want to be a better collaborator to their design counterparts, and better able to execute the creation of complex and beautiful Frontend experiences.
