## Introduction

I have been learning software development full-time since August 2018, and prior to that alongside full-time employment since August 2017. This repo serves as an archive of notes and supporting files from courses I have taken. I map my progress & plan my journey with **[this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1CVyI4S)**.

## Index of courses

1.  **[FreeCodeCamp](free-code-camp)**.\
    Basic tuition with projects to build. Great for beginners.

2.  **[The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](modern-javascript-bootcamp)**.\
    Excellent course with Andrew Mead. This made JavaScript start to 'click' for me.

3.  **[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](algorithms-and-data-structures)**.\
    Concious of being in competition with CS graduates, I took 2 months getting stuck into this course with Colt Steele.

4.  **[Advanced CSS & Sass](advanced-css-and-sass)**.\
    This course goes in-depth and teaches some great CSS tricks & techniques.

5.  **[The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer)**.\
    I took this course to get a high level understanding of product development as a whole.

6.  **[Advanced JavaScript Concepts](advanced-javascript-concepts)**.\
    Deeper into JavaScript, a fantastic course. Andrei Neagoie is an excellent teacher.

7.  **[The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](complete-react-web-developer)**.\
    Only after having a reasonable level of JavaScript knowledge did I start to explore what I always had in mind, React. This course is taught using class based components with hooks as an additional extra.

8.  **[Introduction to Gatsby](frontend-masters--gatsby-intro)**.\
     This course my Jason Lengstorf (of Gatsby at the time of recording) was a great intro. I used this is as a starting point to create my portfolio website.

9.  **[TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide 2020](typescript-complete-developers-guide)**.\
    An in depth course on using TypeScript with Stephen Grider. TypeScript is a valuable skill for catching errors during development, and this course goes in depth with 24.5 hours of video content.

10. **[Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning](learning-to-learn)**.\
    Techniques to better retain content from the courses I take in future.

11. **[Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures & Algorithms](master-the-coding-interview)**.\
    This course goes less in depth than Colt Steele's, and the solutions are similar. However I wanted to gain an additional perspective on CS subjects, plus this course also covers non-technical advice to succeed in interviews.
