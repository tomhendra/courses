## Introduction

I have been learning web development full-time since August 2018, and prior to that alongside full-time employment since August 2017. I am focused on JavaScript, and am mainly using Udemy & Frontend Masters as training resources. This repo serves as storage for supporting files from courses I have been taking. I map my progress & plan my journey with **[this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1CVyI4S)**.

## Index of courses

1.  **[FreeCodeCamp](free-code-camp)**.
    Basic tuition with projects to build. Great for beginners.

2.  **[The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](udemy--modern-javascript-bootcamp)**.
    Excellent course with Andrew Mead. This made JavaScript start to 'click' for me. Andrew is a gifted teacher.

3.  **[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](udemy--algorithms-and-data-structures)**.
    Concious of being in competition with CS graduates, I took 2 months getting stuck into this course with Colt Steele.

4.  **[Advanced CSS & Sass](udemy--advanced-css-and-sass)**.
    A critical subject to grasp. This course goes in-depth and teaches some great tricks & techniques.

5.  **[The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](udemy--complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer)**.
    I took this course to get a high level understanding of product development as a whole.

6.  **[Advanced JavaScript Concepts](udemy--advanced-javascript-concepts)**
    Deeper into JavaScript, another fantastic course. Andrei Neagoie is an excellent teacher.

7.  **[The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](udemy--complete-react-web-developer)**.
    Only after having a reasonable level of JavaScript under my hat did I start to explore what I always had in mind, React. This course was still taught using class based components with hooks as a course extra. Important for understanding pre-hooks code bases that still use a class-based approach. The course currently is being updated, after which I will retake it.

8.  **[Introduction to Gatsby](frontend-masters--gatsby-intro)**
    Frontend Masters is for intermediate & advanced courses. Taught by industry experts the platform gives me great confidence in the material being delivered. This course my Jason Lengstorf (of Gatsby at the time of recording) was a great intro. I used this is as a starting point to create my portfolio website.

9.  **[TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide 2020](udemy--typescript-complete-developers-guide)**.
    An in depth course on using TypeScript with Stephen Grider. TypeScript is a valuable skill for catching errors during development, and this course goes in depth with 24.5 hours of video content.

10. **[Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning](udemy--learning-to-learn)**.
    A course to better retain information from the courses I am take in the future.

In Progress. **[Frontend Masters React Learning Path](frontend-masters--react)**.

In Progress. **[Frontend Masters Design to Code Learning Path](frontend-masters--design-to-code)**.
