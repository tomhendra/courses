## Introduction

I have been learning software development full-time since September 2018, and prior to that alongside full-time employment since September 2017. This repo serves as an archive of notes and supporting files from courses taken since discovering GitHub üôÇ.

I map my progress & plan my journey with **[this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1CVyI4S)**.
