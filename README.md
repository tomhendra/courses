## Introduction

I have been learning software development full-time since August 2018, and prior to that alongside full-time employment since August 2017. This repo serves as an archive of notes and supporting files from the courses I have taken since learning to use GitHub in December 2018. üôÇ

I map my progress & plan my journey with **[this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1CVyI4S)**.

## Index of courses

1.  **[FreeCodeCamp](1-free-code-camp)**\
    Basic tuition with projects to build. Great for beginners getting their feet wet!

2.  **[Udemy: The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](2-modern-javascript-bootcamp)**\
    Excellent foundational course with Andrew Mead. This made JavaScript start to 'click' for me.

3.  **[Udemy: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](3-algorithms-and-data-structures)**\
    To understand what makes software performant, and gain some computer science knowledge, I took 2 months getting stuck into Algorithms and Data Structures with Colt Steele.

4.  **[Udemy: Advanced CSS & Sass](4-advanced-css-and-sass)**\
    This course goes in-depth and teaches some interesting CSS tricks & techniques.

5.  **[Udemy: The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](5-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer)**\
    To gain a high level view of product development as a whole, and an understanding of how the pieces of a modern application's tech stack fit together.

6.  **[Udemy: Advanced JavaScript Concepts](6-advanced-javascript-concepts)**\
    Deeper into JavaScript. Andrei Neagoie is an excellent teacher with a successful background. His teaching style has a way of making topics stick.

7.  **[Udemy: The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](7-complete-react-web-developer)**\
    Only after having a core understanding of JavaScript, did I start to explore what I always had in mind, React. This course is taught using class based components with hooks as an additional extra.

8.  **[Frontend Masters: Introduction to Gatsby](8-gatsby-intro)**\
     Gatsby intro with Jason Lengstorf (of Gatsby at the time of recording). I used this is as a starting point to develop my portfolio website & blog.

9.  **[Udemy: TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide 2020](9-typescript-complete-developers-guide)**\
    TypeScript is an in demand skill used for catching errors during development, and this course with Stephen Grider goes in-depth with 24.5 hours of video content.

10. **[Udemy: Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning](10-learning-to-learn)**\
    Techniques to better retain content from the courses I take in future.

11. **[Udemy: Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures & Algorithms](11-master-the-coding-interview)**\
    This course goes into less detail than Colt Steele's, and the problem solutions are similar. However I wanted to gain an additional perspective on CS topics.

12. **[Atlassian University: Jira Essentials with Agile Mindset](12-jira-essentials-with-agile-mindset)**\
    Many job listings require familiarity with agile methodologies (scrum and/or kanban), and Jira is the most popular project management tool for software development teams.
