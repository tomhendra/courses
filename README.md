## Introduction

I have been learning software development full-time since August 2018, and prior to that alongside full-time employment since August 2017. I am focused on JavaScript, and am mainly using Udemy, Frontend Masters and egghead.io as training resources. This repo is for notes and supporting files from courses I have taken. I map my progress & plan my journey with **[this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/R1CVyI4S)**.

## Index of courses

1.  **[FreeCodeCamp](free-code-camp)**.\
    Basic tuition with projects to build. Great for beginners.

2.  **[The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](modern-javascript-bootcamp)**.\
    Excellent course with Andrew Mead. This made JavaScript start to 'click' for me.

3.  **[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](algorithms-and-data-structures)**.\
    Concious of being in competition with CS graduates, I took 2 months getting stuck into this course with Colt Steele.

4.  **[Advanced CSS & Sass](advanced-css-and-sass)**.\
    This course goes in-depth and teaches some great CSS tricks & techniques.

5.  **[The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer)**.\
    I took this course to get a high level understanding of product development as a whole.

6.  **[Advanced JavaScript Concepts](advanced-javascript-concepts)**.\
    Deeper into JavaScript, a fantastic course. Andrei Neagoie is an excellent teacher.

7.  **[The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](complete-react-web-developer)**.\
    Only after having a reasonable level of JavaScript knowledge did I start to explore what I always had in mind, React. This course is taught using class based components with hooks as an additional extra.

8.  **[Introduction to Gatsby](frontend-masters--gatsby-intro)**.\
     This course my Jason Lengstorf (of Gatsby at the time of recording) was a great intro. I used this is as a starting point to create my portfolio website.

9.  **[TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide 2020](typescript-complete-developers-guide)**.\
    An in depth course on using TypeScript with Stephen Grider. TypeScript is a valuable skill for catching errors during development, and this course goes in depth with 24.5 hours of video content.

10. **[Learning to Learn: Efficient Learning](learning-to-learn)**.\
    Techniques to better retain content from the courses I take in future.

11. **[Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures & Algorithms](master-the-coding-interview)**.\
    This course goes less in depth than Colt Steele's, and the solutions are similar. However I wanted to gain an additional perspective on CS subjects, plus this course also covers non-technical advice to succeed in interviews.

Up until this point I had been mainly using Udemy as a learning resource. Frontend Masters provides content taught by industry experts, which gives confidence in the quality of material being delivered. It is aimed at intermediate to advanced level engineers, so moving forward with this platform is a natural progression.

My daily schedule going forward is as follows.

- Frontend Masters: 3 hours
- LeetCode sessions: 2 hours
- Project building: 3 hours
- Egghead.io: Any gaps in knowledge that arise during project building.
